Kindred,Octavia E. Butler,2004-02-01,Fiction,"NEW FOREWORD BY JANELLE MONÁE Selected by The Atlantic as one of THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVELS. From the New York Times bestselling author of Parable of the Sower and MacArthur “Genius” Grant, Nebula, and Hugo award winner The visionary time-travel classic whose Black female hero is pulled through time to face the horrors of American slavery and explores the impacts of racism, sexism, and white supremacy then and now. “I lost an arm on my last trip home. My left arm.” Dana’s torment begins when she suddenly vanishes on her 26th birthday from California, 1976, and is dragged through time to antebellum Maryland to rescue a boy named Rufus, heir to a slaveowner’s plantation. She soon realizes the purpose of her summons to the past: protect Rufus to ensure his assault of her Black ancestor so that she may one day be born. As she endures the traumas of slavery and the soul-crushing normalization of savagery, Dana fights to keep her autonomy and return to the present. Blazing the trail for neo-slavery narratives like Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad and Ta-Nehisi Coates’s The Water Dancer, Butler takes one of speculative fiction’s oldest tropes and infuses it with lasting depth and power. Dana not only experiences the cruelties of slavery on her skin but also grimly learns to accept it as a condition of her own existence in the present. “Where stories about American slavery are often gratuitous, reducing its horror to explicit violence and brutality, Kindred is controlled and precise” (New York Times). “Reading Octavia Butler taught me to dream big, and I think it’s absolutely necessary that everybody have that freedom and that willingness to dream.” —N. K. Jemisin",2.5

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,F. Scott Fitzgerald,2008,Nineteen twenties,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's most memorable short stories. The protagonist, Benjamin Button, is born an old man and ages in reverse until he becomes a baby and then finally vanishes from the earth. In a short introduction to the story, Fitzgerald wrote: ""This story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end. By trying the experiment upon only one man in a perfectly normal world I have scarcely given his idea a fair trial. Several weeks after completing it, I discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's 'Note-books.' ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" was the inspiration for the major motion picture of the same name and remains one of Fitzgerald's most haunting and beautiful tales. This collection also includes three other Jazz Age tales by Fitzgerald.",4

Years ago, bookseller and mystery aficionado Malcolm Kershaw compiled a list of the genre’s most unsolvable murders, those that are almost impossible to crack—which he titled “Eight Perfect Murders”—chosen from among the best of the best including Agatha Christie’s A. B. C. Murders, Patricia Highsmith’s Strangers on a Train, Ira Levin’s Deathtrap, A. A. Milne's The Red House Mystery, Anthony Berkeley Cox's Malice Aforethought, James M.

But no one is more surprised than Mal, now the owner of the Old Devils Bookstore in Boston, when an FBI agent comes knocking on his door one snowy day in February. She’s looking for information about a series of unsolved murders that look eerily similar to the killings on Mal’s old list. And the FBI agent isn’t the only one interested in this bookseller who spends almost every night at home reading. The killer is out there, watching his every move—a diabolical threat who knows way too much about Mal’s personal history, especially the secrets he’s never told anyone, even his recently deceased wife. To protect himself, Mal begins looking into possible suspects . . . and sees a killer in everyone around him. But Mal doesn’t count on the investigation leaving a trail of death in its wake. Suddenly, a series of shocking twists leaves more victims dead—and the noose around Mal’s neck grows so tight he might never escape.",4.5

"Someday, Someday, Maybe",Lauren Graham,2013-04-30,Fiction,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From Lauren Graham, the beloved star of Gilmore Girls and Parenthood, comes a witty, charming, and hilariously relatable debut novel about a struggling young actress trying to get ahead―and keep it together―in New York City. It’s January 1995, and Franny Banks has just six months left of the three-year deadline she set for herself when she came to New York, dreaming of Broadway and doing “important” work. But all she has to show for her efforts so far is a part in an ad for ugly Christmas sweaters, and a gig waiting tables at a comedy club. Her roommates―her best friend Jane, and Dan, an aspiring sci-fi writer―are supportive, yet Franny knows a two-person fan club doesn’t exactly count as success. Everyone tells her she needs a backup plan, and though she can almost picture moving back home and settling down with her perfectly nice ex-boyfriend, she’s not ready to give up on her goal of having a career like her idols Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. Not just yet. But while she dreams of filling their shoes, in the meantime, she’d happily settle for a speaking part in almost anything—and finding a hair product combination that works. Everything is riding on the upcoming showcase for her acting class, where she’ll finally have a chance to perform for people who could actually hire her. And she can’t let herself be distracted by James Franklin, a notorious flirt and the most successful actor in her class, even though he’s suddenly started paying attention. Meanwhile, her bank account is rapidly dwindling, her father wants her to come home, and her agent doesn’t return her calls. But for some reason, she keeps believing that she just might get what she came for. Someday, Someday, Maybe is a story about hopes and dreams, being young in a city, and wanting something deeply, madly, desperately. It’s about finding love, finding yourself, and perhaps most difficult of all in New York City, finding an acting job. Praise for Someday, Someday, Maybe “A winning, entertaining read . . .

A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: The New York Times, Washington Post, NPR, Oprah Daily, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek Chemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman.

But like science, life is unpredictable. Which is why a few years later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother, but the reluctant star of America’s most beloved cooking show Supper at Six. Elizabeth’s unusual approach to cooking (“combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride”) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn’t just teaching women to cook. She’s daring them to change the status quo. Laugh-out-loud funny, shrewdly observant, and studded with a dazzling cast of supporting characters, Lessons in Chemistry is as original and vibrant as its protagonist.",5

"Thiên Tài Bên Trái, Kẻ Điên Bên Phải","Cao Minh, StreetLib",,Fiction,"NẾU MỘT NGÀY ANH THẤY TÔI ĐIÊN, THỰC RA CHÍNH LÀ ANH ĐIÊN ĐẤY! Hỡi những con người đang oằn mình trong cuộc sống, bạn biết gì về thế giới của mình? Là vô vàn thứ lý thuyết được các bậc vĩ nhân kiểm chứng, là luật lệ, là cả nghìn thứ sự thật bọc trong cái lốt hiển nhiên, hay những triết lý cứng nhắc của cuộc đời? Lại đây, vượt qua thứ nhận thức tẻ nhạt bị đóng kín bằng con mắt trần gian, khai mở toàn bộ suy nghĩ, để dòng máu trong bạn sục sôi trước những điều kỳ vĩ, phá vỡ mọi quy tắc. Thế giới sẽ gọi bạn là kẻ điên, nhưng vậy thì có sao? Ranh giới duy nhất giữa kẻ điên và thiên tài chẳng qua là một sợi chỉ mỏng manh: Thiên tài chứng minh được thế giới của mình, còn kẻ điên chưa kịp làm điều đó. Chọn trở thành một kẻ điên để vẫy vùng giữa nhân gian loạn thế hay khóa hết chúng lại, sống mãi một cuộc đời bình thường khiến bạn cảm thấy hạnh phúc hơn? Thiên tài bên trái, kẻ điên bên phải là cuốn sách dành cho những người điên rồ, những kẻ gây rối, những người chống đối, những mảnh ghép hình tròn trong những ô vuông không vừa vặn… những người nhìn mọi thứ khác biệt, không quan tâm đến quy tắc. Bạn có thể đồng ý, có thể phản đối, có thể vinh danh hay lăng mạ họ, nhưng điều duy nhất bạn không thể làm là phủ nhận sự tồn tại của họ. Đó là những người luôn tạo ra sự thay đổi trong khi hầu hết con người chỉ sống rập khuôn như một cái máy. Đa số đều nghĩ họ thật điên rồ nhưng nếu nhìn ở góc khác, ta lại thấy họ thiên tài. Bởi chỉ những người đủ điên nghĩ rằng họ có thể thay đổi thế giới mới là những người làm được điều đó. Chào mừng đến với thế giới của những kẻ điên. *** THIÊN TÀI BÊN TRÁI, KẺ ĐIÊN BÊN PHẢI, VẬY Ở GIỮA LÀ GÌ? Có thể bạn đã biết, thiên tài và bệnh nhân tâm thần chỉ cách nhau bởi một lằn ranh mỏng manh. Họ đều là những kẻ mang trong mình góc nhìn quái dị, ý tưởng lạ lùng, tư duy khác biệt và những hành động bị xem là “chả ra làm sao, chả hợp thời”. Sự khác nhau giữa thiên tài và người bệnh tâm thần ở chỗ, một bên chứng minh được thế giới quan của họ, bên còn lại thì chưa. Dù vậy, ta không thể phủ nhận thế giới trong mắt của bệnh nhân tâm thần có nhiều điểm thú vị. Thế giới rất rộng lớn và ẩn chứa nhiều điều kỳ diệu mà cho đến giờ, con người vẫn chưa thể lý giải hết. Thế giới cũng đầy những quy tắc và hệ thống một cách nghiêm ngặt. Con người chúng ta, đa số chỉ có thể cảm nhận được một phần nhỏ trong đó. Hiểu biết của chúng ta về thế giới vô cùng hạn hẹp và phiến diện. Vậy nếu ta hiếu kỳ về thế giới này và muốn biết thêm nhiều góc nhìn mới lạ về nó thì sao? Tác giả Cao Minh đã lựa chọn phương pháp tiếp xúc với những bệnh nhân tâm thần để khám phá những góc nhìn mới lạ ấy. Đó là lý do mà cuốn “Thiên tài bên trái, kẻ điên bên phải” ra đời. Cuốn sách là tập hợp các bài phỏng vấn giữa tác giả và những bệnh nhân tâm thần. Bằng cách đặt những câu hỏi hết sức khéo léo và thông minh, tác giả cố gắng thâm nhập vào thế giới của những bệnh nhân tâm thần, qua đó thể nghiệm thế giới quan của họ. Trong quá trình tiếp xúc, tác giả đã nhận ra một điều thú vị rằng “rất nhiều bệnh nhân tâm thần có đủ khả năng nhanh chóng tìm ra một cách giải thích. Không cần biết là quỷ, hồ, tiên, quái hay vật lý, sinh học, họ đều rất kiên định xác nhận.” Chẳng hạn như lần tác giả phỏng vấn một bệnh nhân tâm thần là thiếu niên 17 tuổi. Cậu am hiểu vật lý lượng tử theo một cách kỳ dị đến mức, để giao lưu được với cậu, tác giả phải nhồi nhét các kiến thức về vật lý, sinh học; dẫn theo một người trợ giúp là giáo sư vật lý lượng tử trẻ để giải thích những lời cậu nói theo ngôn ngữ chuyên ngành thông thường. Vấn đề là những điều cậu biết, theo như lời cậu nói, là do một sinh vật bốn chiều bảo với cậu, có cả đọc trong sách. Sinh vật bốn chiều ấy, “một phần kết cấu của nó mang tính phi vật chất, chỉ có thể cảm nhận được”. Cậu không thể lý giải được cảm giác nó mang đến cho cậu. Đến đây thì tác giả bắt đầu chất vấn: “Tôi (tác giả): Nhưng sao cậu chứng thực được cảm giác của cậu là chính xác, đúng hơn là làm sao cậu chứng minh được có ai đó mang đến cho cậu cảm giác đó? Cậu lạnh lùng nhìn tôi: Lùi lại hơn một trăm năm trước, nếu anh nói với một học giả vật lý hàng đầu thời đó rằng, anh chỉ cần cầm một vật không to bằng tay, không dày bằng cuốn sách là có thể nói chuyện với một người ở nơi xa, nhờ vệ tinh bay quanh địa cầu và một cái thẻ bé bằng móng tay nằm trong vật đó; anh có thể ngồi trước một màn hình nhỏ bé nói chuyện với người lạ cách xa hàng ngàn dặm mà không cần dùng bất cứ sợi dây liên kết nào; anh xem một trận bóng đá ở bên kia địa cầu chỉ nhờ ấn điều khiển tivi; người đó sẽ nghĩ thế nào? Ông ta sẽ nghĩ anh bị điên! Bởi chúng vượt quá phạm trù của bất cứ ngành khoa học nào thời đó, được liệt vào dạng những điều bất hợp lý, đúng không? […] Không lâu sau, cậu thiếu niên đồng ý làm một bài kiểm tra vật lý lượng tử được chuẩn bị riêng cho cậu ấy nhưng kết quả rất tệ. Không biết vì sao, sau khi nghe kết quả đó tôi có chút thất vọng. Nếu cậu ấy thật sự là một thiên tài, cậu ấy cũng chỉ có thể là thiên tài ở tương lai trăm năm sau, thậm chí xa hơn nữa, chứ không thuộc về thời đại của chúng ta. […] Viết đến đây, tôi bỗng nhớ đến một câu Goethe từng nói: ‘Chân lý thuộc về con người, sai lầm thuộc về thời đại.’” Ngoài ra còn rất nhiều cuộc phỏng vấn với đủ kiểu bệnh nhân tâm thần mang trong mình các vấn đề khác nhau. Có cái hài hước thú vị, có cái làm tác giả và người đọc phải sững sờ đến đáng sợ. Nhiều bệnh nhân có hệ thống logic hoàn thiện đến mức tác giả phải tự hỏi mình, liệu người không đúng có phải là chính tác giả – những người được xem là “bình thường”? Liệu họ có đúng là bệnh nhân tâm thần không? Ở vài cuộc phỏng vấn, tác giả đặt câu hỏi để dẫn dắt câu chuyện nhưng cuối cùng, hóa ra người bị là dẫn dắt là tác giả. Kẻ đi săn bỗng chốc thành con mồi. :)) Thiên tài bên trái, kẻ điên bên phải, vậy ở giữa là gì? Ở giữa phải chăng là những con người bình thường, sống cuộc đời rập khuôn như một cái máy? Khi thấy những kẻ mang ý tưởng quái lạ, nếu nhìn bên phải, họ bị tâm thần. Nhưng nếu thay đổi góc nhìn, hướng mặt sang bên trái thì họ là thiên tài. Dù là tâm thần hay thiên tài thì ta không thể phủ nhận rằng, họ là những gã đầy bản lĩnh khi dám đập tan gông xiềng của quy tắc, đạp đổ mọi rào cản với mơ ước thay đổi thế giới. Cuốn sách phù hợp với những bạn thích chiêm nghiệm về thế giới, mang tư duy mở, không ngại đón nhận những góc nhìn khác lạ. – Kim Ngân Đọc “Thiên tài bên trái, kẻ điên bên phải” là một trải nghiệm khá mới, vì trước giờ mình chỉ đọc tiểu thuyết lãng mạn, như Nguyễn Nhật Ánh hay Ichikawa Takuji ấy, đọc cuốn Thiên tài là vì dạo đây khá nhiều người giới thiệu nên cũng tò mò tìm đọc. Cuốn “Thiên tài bên trái, kẻ điên bên phải”, nếu không kiên nhẫn sẽ không đọc được, vì muốn đọc, bạn sẽ phải từ bỏ lối suy nghĩ bình thường, những thường thức đã trở thành chân lý trong bạn. Mà từ bỏ rồi, đọc được rồi có hiểu hay không là do bạn. (Nhưng cuốn này hay thật, hấp dẫn thật đó.) Nói cuốn sách này là truyện cũng không đúng lắm, nói nó là một tập hồi ký của những người tác giả đã tiếp xúc sẽ hợp hơn, vì toàn bộ cuốn sách là những cuộc đối thoại của tác giả và những bệnh nhân tâm thần tác giả có cơ hội tiếp xúc, tác giả là người dẫn dắt cho bệnh nhân trao đổi, chia sẻ về cách nghĩ, tư duy của họ. Người khác nói, nghe người bệnh nói làm gì, họ không phải bị điên sao, bị điên mới vào viện tâm thần. Nhưng đọc cuốn sách này, mình lại thấy, họ không điên. Cách nghĩ của họ chỉ là khác với tư duy của đại chúng mà thôi. Vì họ là thiểu số, khác với đa số, nên họ là “người điên”. Và họ rất cô độc. “Tôi bây giờ không có bạn bè, bố mẹ đều qua đời rồi, không người nhà, không kết hôn, không con cái, bởi tôi đã không còn để tâm đến những điều đó. Tôi chỉ hy vọng có người đồng hành, thấu hiểu sự cô độc này, cho dù đó là ai. Có thể các anh sẽ nghĩ tôi mắc bệnh tâm thần, cứ cho là vậy đi, tôi cũng không quan tâm, chỉ hy vọng tìm được người có những trải nghiệm giống mình, hiểu được cảm giác của mình thôi. […] Có thể… có thể tôi bị mắc bệnh tâm thần, chỉ là tôi có tiền, không ai cảm thấy tôi điên, những người không có tiền mới thành kẻ điên… Có thể tìm thấy một người giống mình thì tốt, dù chỉ là một người.” Họ cô độc vì không ai hiểu họ, họ cô độc vì trong thế giới của họ chỉ có một người. Có lẽ trong số họ có những người thực sự có tài năng thiên bẩm, nhưng vì khác với số đông, họ trở thành “kẻ điên”, “người tâm thần”. Và họ có lẽ luôn mong mỏi một người có thể hiểu được họ, để thế giới của họ không còn chỉ có mỗi họ. “Thiên tài bên trái, kẻ điên bên phải” là một cuốn sách đầy sự hack não, xoắn tư duy, vặn logic, nhưng cũng đầy sự cô đơn, dù không phải mỗi người trong mỗi câu truyện đều nói ra lời. Nếu có hứng thú với những điều kỳ lạ, khác với lẽ thường, đừng bỏ qua cuốn sách này, vì họ sẽ đưa bạn đến những thế giới quan vô cùng độc đáo, vô cùng thú vị. Nếu không, cũng đừng vội quay lưng, hãy cho cuốn sách này một cơ hội, cho bản thân một cơ hội, để thấy rằng họ cũng như bao người thôi, cũng có cảm xúc, cũng có hỉ nộ ai lạc. Vì dù là thiên tài hay kẻ điên, họ cũng đều là người. – Nguyễn Hà Chi “Probatio Diabolica” (Devil’s Proof) “Chứng minh cái gì đó không tồn tại là loại chứng minh bất khả, được gọi là ‘probatio diabolica’ (devil’s proof), hay ‘chứng minh sự tồn tại của ma quỷ’.” Ví dụ đơn giản, bạn không thể chứng minh sự tồn tại của ma quỷ bằng chứng cứ xác thực, nhưng cũng không thể phủ nhận tuyệt đối sự tồn tại của ma quỷ, cũng bởi thiếu chứng cứ. Đó là một vấn đề tiến thoái lưỡng nan mà đến giờ câu trả lời vẫn bị bỏ ngỏ. “Chứng minh ma quỷ”, cũng chính là quan điểm của những người trong cuốn “Thiên tài bên trái kẻ điên bên phải” vậy. Nếu bạn muốn tìm một cuốn sách khoa học với chứng cớ xác thực, luận điểm rõ ràng, phân tích kĩ càng chặt chẽ, thì có lẽ cuốn sách này không phải ứng cử viên phù hợp cho bạn lắm. Nhưng nếu bạn muốn tìm kiếm sự mới lạ trong những nan đề không lời giải, trong những pha xoắn não vì những lời của những người mà xã hội gọi là kẻ điên, thì sao không dành chút thời gian tìm hiểu cuốn sách này nhỉ? Chỉ cần đọc qua một vài trang, bạn sẽ bị cuốn vào những quan điểm “tưởng vô lý mà lại hợp lý”, dù có phản đối, bạn cũng khó mà tìm được lý lẽ để hoàn toàn phủ nhận quan điểm của họ. Thiên tài và kẻ điên, ngăn cách với phần đông xã hội bằng một ranh giới mang tên “bình thường”. Nhưng cái gọi là “bình thường” cũng có khi là một “chứng minh ma quỷ” đấy. “NẾU MỘT NGÀY ANH THẤY TÔI ĐIÊN, THẬT RA CHÍNH LÀ ANH ĐIÊN.” – Phương Nhuế Hân Thế giới mới về tâm lý học và những câu chuyện đa sắc về những-người-đặc-biệt. Ji Hae Soo trong bộ phim “It ok that’s love” từng nói: “Ai trong chúng ta cũng đều mắc bệnh tâm lý, điều kỳ diệu là chúng ta có thể vượt qua chúng bằng tình yêu thương của mọi người xung quanh!”. Chọn cuốn sách này mặc dù đây là thể loại khá lạ trong số các thể loại sách hay truyện về tâm lý học mình từng đọc. Những mẩu chuyện, hay nói đúng hơn là những đoạn hội thoại giữa một bác sĩ tâm lý và những “ca bệnh” đặc biệt của anh. Nếu nghe đến đây mọi người có thể cho rằng, thế thì cuốn sách này tẻ nhạt và không hấp dẫn vì không có tình tiết và diễn biến kịch tính như các tác phẩm tâm lý tội phạm điều tra phá án. Nếu thế thì không cần đọc tiếp review và cũng bỏ qua luôn tác phẩm này đi. Vì giá trị của cuốn sách này nó không nằm ở việc câu kéo sự tò mò bằng những tình tiết tượng tượng, hoặc sao chép từ đâu đó, học hỏi từ đâu đó. Cuốn sách là một kho những kiến thức sâu rộng và cực kỳ cuốn hút về tâm lý học và những ai muốn hiểu rõ về phạm trù khó nhằn này. Sẵn sàng chấp nhận dành tận 3 tháng chỉ để đọc đi đọc lại các mẩu chuyện nhỏ, “Thiên tài bên trái, kẻ điên bên phải” là cuốn sách mình đọc lâu xong nhất, có thể coi là kỷ lục lâu, nhưng lâu một cách xứng đáng. Một cuốn sách có giá trị thực tiễn sẽ tốn của người đọc nhiều thời gian hơn. Thông qua những câu chuyện trong đó, muốn hiểu, phải đọc đi đọc lại nhiều lần, và phải rất tập trung, vì tác giả kết hợp rất hay ngôn ngữ kể chuyện lồng ghép với kiến thức uyên thâm về tâm lý học. Nhất là những thứ ở đây, những tình huống và những bệnh nhân mà tác giả gặp, bạn sẽ không thể gặp ở bất cứ đâu. Mỗi một bệnh nhân tâm lý đều có một thế giới duy ngã của riêng mình, đó là một thế giới quan được nhìn dưới lăng kính cảm nhận của người đó. Có thể với những người-bình-thường khác thì họ là những kẻ lập dị, tư tưởng hoang đường và quan niệm khác về cuộc sống. Nhưng sự thật có phải như vậy không? Chỉ khi chúng ta thật sự bước vào thế giới của ai đó, chúng ta mới hiểu vì sao họ có lối sống như vậy, và chỉ khi chúng ta hiểu được cách tiếp nhận khác, chúng ta sẽ nhìn thấy một thế giới khác. “Thiên tài bên trái, kẻ điên bên phải” không phải là cuốn sách giải trí, đọc cho vui, càng không phải là cuốn sách màu mè tô vẽ để câu kéo sự chú ý của người đọc. Nó là cuốn sách giống cánh cửa đi vào một thế giới khác, với những góc nhìn khác về tâm lý học, và thực sự đã thuyết phục một người thích tìm hiểu về tâm lý học như mình. Đáng đọc, cũng đáng để đọc kỹ. Mời các bạn đón đọc Thiên Tài Bên Trái, Kẻ Điên Bên Phải của tác giả Cao Minh.",3

"Wizards, Aliens, and Starships",Charles L. Adler,2014-02-02,Science,"Explaining the science behind science fiction and fantasy—from the probable to the impossible From teleportation and space elevators to alien contact and interstellar travel, science fiction and fantasy writers have come up with some brilliant and innovative ideas. Yet how plausible are these ideas--for instance, could Mr. Weasley's flying car in the Harry Potter books really exist? Which concepts might actually happen, and which ones wouldn’t work at all? Wizards, Aliens, and Starships delves into the most extraordinary details in science fiction and fantasy--such as time warps, shape changing, rocket launches, and illumination by floating candle--and shows readers the physics and math behind the phenomena. With simple mathematical models, and in most cases using no more than high school algebra, Charles Adler ranges across a plethora of remarkable imaginings, from the works of Ursula K. Le Guin to Star Trek and Avatar, to explore what might become reality. Adler explains why fantasy in the Harry Potter and Dresden Files novels cannot adhere strictly to scientific laws, and when magic might make scientific sense in the muggle world. He examines space travel and wonders why it isn’t cheaper and more common today. Adler also discusses exoplanets and how the search for alien life has shifted from radio communications to space-based telescopes. He concludes by investigating the future survival of humanity and other intelligent races. Throughout, he cites an abundance of science fiction and fantasy authors, and includes concise descriptions of stories as well as an appendix on Newton's laws of motion. Wizards, Aliens, and Starships will speak to anyone wanting to know about the correct--and incorrect--science of science fiction and fantasy.",5

Silicon Second Nature,Stefan Helmreich,1998-11-16,Science,"Silicon Second Nature takes us on an expedition into an extraordinary world where nature is made of bits and bytes and life is born from sequences of zeroes and ones. Artificial Life is the brainchild of scientists who view self-replicating computer programs—such as computer viruses—as new forms of life. Anthropologist Stefan Helmreich's look at the social and simulated worlds of Artificial Life—primarily at the Santa Fe Institute, a well-known center for studies in the sciences of complexity—introduces readers to the people and programs connected with this unusual hybrid of computer science and biology. When biology becomes an information science, when DNA is downloaded into virtual reality, new ways of imagining ""life"" become possible. Through detailed dissections of the artifacts of Artifical Life, Helmreich explores how these novel visions of life are recombining with the most traditional tales told by Western culture. Because Artificial Life scientists tend to see themselves as masculine gods of their cyberspace creations, as digital Darwins exploring frontiers filled with primitive creatures, their programs reflect prevalent representations of gender, kinship, and race, and repeat origin stories most familiar from mythical and religious narratives. But Artificial Life does not, Helmreich says, simply reproduce old stories in new software. Much like contemporary activities of cloning, cryonics, and transgenics, the practice of simulating and synthesizing life in silico challenges and multiplies the very definition of vitality. Are these models, as some would claim, actually another form of the real thing? Silicon Second Nature takes Artifical Life as a symptom and source of our mutating visions of life itself.",3

The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III,Peter Byrne,2010-05-06,Science,"Peter Byrne tells the story of Hugh Everett III (1930-1982), whose ""many worlds"" theory of multiple universes has had a profound impact on physics and philosophy. Using Everett's unpublished papers (recently discovered in his son's basement) and dozens of interviews with his friends, colleagues, and surviving family members, Byrne paints, for the general reader, a detailed portrait of the genius who invented an astonishing way of describing our complex universe from the inside. Everett's mathematical model (called the ""universal wave function"") treats all possible events as ""equally real"", and concludes that countless copies of every person and thing exist in all possible configurations spread over an infinity of universes: many worlds. Afflicted by depression and addictions, Everett strove to bring rational order to the professional realms in which he played historically significant roles. In addition to his famous interpretation of quantum mechanics, Everett wrote a classic paper in game theory; created computer algorithms that revolutionized military operations research; and performed pioneering work in artificial intelligence for top secret government projects. He wrote the original software for targeting cities in a nuclear hot war; and he was one of the first scientists to recognize the danger of nuclear winter. As a Cold Warrior, he designed logical systems that modeled ""rational"" human and machine behaviors, and yet he was largely oblivious to the emotional damage his irrational personal behavior inflicted upon his family, lovers, and business partners. He died young, but left behind a fascinating record of his life, including correspondence with such philosophically inclined physicists as Niels Bohr, Norbert Wiener, and John Wheeler. These remarkable letters illuminate the long and often bitter struggle to explain the paradox of measurement at the heart of quantum physics. In recent years, Everett's solution to this mysterious problem - the existence of a universe of universes - has gained considerable traction in scientific circles, not as science fiction, but as an explanation of physical reality.",5

The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom,James M. McPherson,2003-12-11,History,"Filled with fresh interpretations and information, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, Battle Cry of Freedom will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War. James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles, the strategic maneuvering on both sides, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory. The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This ""new birth of freedom,"" as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict. This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing ""second American Revolution"" we call the Civil War, a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.",3.5

Ancient Rome,Paul A. Zoch,2012-11-28,History,"The events and personalities of ancient Rome spring to life in this history, from its founding in 753 B.C. to the death of the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius in A.D. 180. Paul A. Zoch presents, in contemporary language, the history of Rome and the stories of its protagonists?such as Romulus and Remus, Horatius, and Nero-which are so often omitted from more specialized studies. With an eye detail, Zoch guides his readers through the military campaigns and political developments that shaped Rome’s rise from a small Italian city to the greatest imperial power the world had ever known. We witness the long struggle against the enemy city of Carthage. We follow Caesar as he campaigns in Britain, and we observe the ebb and flow of Rome’s fortunes in the Hellenistic East. Writing with the belief that such stories contain moral lessons that are relevant today, Zoch presents a narrative that is both entertaining and informative. An afterword takes the history to the fall of the Roman Empire in the West in A.D. 476.",5
"Crow Killer, New Edition","Raymond W. Thorp, Jr., Robert Bunker",2016-01-04,History,"The movie Jeremiah Johnson introduced millions to the legendary mountain man, John Johnson. The real Johnson was a far cry from the Redford version. Standing 6'2"" in his stocking feet and weighing nearly 250 pounds, he was a mountain man among mountain men, one of the toughest customers on the western frontier. As the story goes, one morning in 1847 Johnson returned to his Rocky Mountain trapper's cabin to find the remains of his murdered Indian wife and her unborn child. He vowed vengeance against an entire Indian tribe. Crow Killer tells of that one-man, decades-long war to avenge his beloved. Whether seen as a realistic glimpse of a long ago, fierce frontier world, or as a mythic retelling of the many tales spun around and by Johnson, Crow Killer is unforgettable. This new edition, redesigned for the first time, features an introduction by western frontier expert Nathan E. Bender and a glossary of Indian tribes.",5

Empire of Liberty,Gordon S. Wood,2009-10-28,History,"The Oxford History of the United States is by far the most respected multi-volume history of our nation. The series includes three Pulitzer Prize winners, two New York Times bestsellers, and winners of the Bancroft and Parkman Prizes. Now, in the newest volume in the series, one of America's most esteemed historians, Gordon S. Wood, offers a brilliant account of the early American Republic, ranging from 1789 and the beginning of the national government to the end of the War of 1812. As Wood reveals, the period was marked by tumultuous change in all aspects of American life--in politics, society, economy, and culture. The men who founded the new government had high hopes for the future, but few of their hopes and dreams worked out quite as they expected. They hated political parties but parties nonetheless emerged. Some wanted the United States to become a great fiscal-military state like those of Britain and France; others wanted the country to remain a rural agricultural state very different from the European states. Instead, by 1815 the United States became something neither group anticipated. Many leaders expected American culture to flourish and surpass that of Europe; instead it became popularized and vulgarized. The leaders also hope to see the end of slavery; instead, despite the release of many slaves and the end of slavery in the North, slavery was stronger in 1815 than it had been in 1789. Many wanted to avoid entanglements with Europe, but instead the country became involved in Europe's wars and ended up waging another war with the former mother country. Still, with a new generation emerging by 1815, most Americans were confident and optimistic about the future of their country. Named a New York Times Notable Book, Empire of Liberty offers a marvelous account of this pivotal era when America took its first unsteady steps as a new and rapidly expanding nation.",3
The Last Castle,Denise Kiernan,2017-09-26,Biography & Autobiography,"A New York Times bestseller with an ""engaging narrative and array of detail” (The Wall Street Journal), the “intimate and sweeping” (Raleigh News & Observer) untold, true story behind the Biltmore Estate—the largest, grandest private residence in North America, which has seen more than 120 years of history pass by its front door. The story of Biltmore spans World Wars, the Jazz Age, the Depression, and generations of the famous Vanderbilt family, and features a captivating cast of real-life characters including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Thomas Wolfe, Teddy Roosevelt, John Singer Sargent, James Whistler, Henry James, and Edith Wharton. Orphaned at a young age, Edith Stuyvesant Dresser claimed lineage from one of New York’s best known families. She grew up in Newport and Paris, and her engagement and marriage to George Vanderbilt was one of the most watched events of Gilded Age society. But none of this prepared her to be mistress of Biltmore House. Before their marriage, the wealthy and bookish Vanderbilt had dedicated his life to creating a spectacular European-style estate on 125,000 acres of North Carolina wilderness. He summoned the famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to tame the grounds, collaborated with celebrated architect Richard Morris Hunt to build a 175,000-square-foot chateau, filled it with priceless art and antiques, and erected a charming village beyond the gates. Newlywed Edith was now mistress of an estate nearly three times the size of Washington, DC and benefactress of the village and surrounding rural area. When fortunes shifted and changing times threatened her family, her home, and her community, it was up to Edith to save Biltmore—and secure the future of the region and her husband’s legacy. This is the fascinating, “soaring and gorgeous” (Karen Abbott) story of how the largest house in America flourished, faltered, and ultimately endured to this day.",3
The Heart of Islam,Seyyed Hossein Nasr,2009-03-17,Religion,"As the specter of religious extremism has become a fact of life today, the temptation is great to allow the evil actions and perspectives of a minority to represent an entire tradition. In the case of Islam, there has been much recent confusion in the Western world centered on distorted portrayals of its core values. Born of ignorance, such confusion feeds the very problem at hand. In The Heart of Islam one of the great intellectual figures in Islamic history offers a timely presentation of the core spiritual and social values of Islam: peace, compassion, social justice, and respect for the other. Seizing this unique moment in history to reflect on the essence of his tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr seeks to ""open a spiritual and intellectual space for mutual understanding."" Exploring Islamic values in scripture, traditional sources, and history, he also shows their clear counterparts in the Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing the common ground of the Abrahamic faiths. Nasr challenges members of the world's civilizations to stop demonizing others while identifying themselves with pure goodness and to turn instead to a deeper understanding of those shared values that can solve the acute problems facing humanity today. ""Muslims must ask themselves what went wrong within their own societies,"" he writes, ""but the West must also pose the same question about itself . . . whether we are Muslims, Jews, Christians, or even secularists, whether we live in the Islamic world or in the West, we are in need of meaning in our lives, of ethical norms to guide our actions, of a vision that would allow us to live at peace with each other and with the rest of God's creation."" Such help, he believes, lies at the heart of every religion and can lead the followers of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well as other religious and spiritual traditions to a new future of mutual respect and common global purpose. The Heart of Islam is a landmark presentation of enduring value that offers hope to humanity, and a compelling portrait of the beauty and appeal of the faith of 1.2 billion people.",3.5

As the definitive single-volume answer to that question, this enthralling book has never been superseded. It is an American classic.

Searching for Vedic India,Devamrita Swami,2002,History,"Deep in lost history, did high civilizations and advanced knowledge thrive? The ancient Vedic literatures of India describe a worldwide civilization that flourished at a time when modern historians insist that humans like us existed simply as hunter-gatherers. This Vedic civilization, centered in India, employed technologies based on a scientific under­standing of the physical elements and forces we know today, as well as more subtle conscious elements. Devamrita Swami, who has spent a lifetime in his own search for Vedic India, takes us on a journey of intellectual discovery through the history of the remarkable Vedic civilization and its knowledge, locked in the ancient literatures of India. His wit and wisdom combine to make our search for Vedic India not only illuminating but entertaining. He tells us not only the truths of Vedic India, but how they are again coming to be. Searching for Vedic India thus takes us not only into the past, but into the future.",5
A Long Way Gone,Ishmael Beah,2007-04-01,Biography & Autobiography,"In A Long Way Gone Ishmael Beah tells a riveting story in his own words: how, at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he'd been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts. My new friends have begun to suspect I haven't told them the full story of my life. ""Why did you leave Sierra Leone?"" ""Because there is a war."" ""You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?"" ""Yes, all the time."" ""Cool."" I smile a little. ""You should tell us about it sometime."" ""Yes, sometime."" This is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived. This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.",4

American Carnage,Tim Alberta,2019-07-16,Political Science,"New York Times Bestseller “Not a conventional Trump-era book. It is less about the daily mayhem in the White House than about the unprecedented capitulation of a political party. This book will endure for helping us understand not what is happening but why it happened…. [An] indispensable work.”—Washington Post Politico Magazine’s chief political correspondent provides a rollicking insider’s look at the making of the modern Republican Party—how a decade of cultural upheaval, populist outrage, and ideological warfare made the GOP vulnerable to a hostile takeover from the unlikeliest of insurgents: Donald J. Trump. As George W. Bush left office with record-low approval ratings and Barack Obama led a Democratic takeover of Washington, Republicans faced a moment of reckoning: they had no vision, no generation of new leaders, and no energy in the party’s base. Yet Obama’s progressive agenda, coupled with the nation’s rapidly changing cultural identity, lit a fire under the right. Republicans regained power in Congress but spent that time fighting among themselves. With these struggles weakening the party’s defenses, and with more and more Americans losing faith in the political class, the stage was set for an outsider to crash the party. When Trump descended a gilded escalator to launch his campaign in the summer of 2015, the candidate had met the moment. Only by viewing Trump as the culmination of a decade-long civil war inside the GOP can we appreciate how he won the White House and consider the fundamental questions at the center of America’s current turmoil. Loaded with explosive original reporting and based on hundreds of exclusive interviews—including with key players such as President Trump, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell—American Carnage takes us behind the scenes of this tumultuous period and establishes Tim Alberta as the premier chronicler of a political era.",5

Elizabeth the Queen,Sally Bedell Smith,2012-01-10,Biography & Autobiography,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • This “excellent, all-embracing” (The New York Times) biography of Queen Elizabeth II is a magisterial study of the woman known only from a distance—and a captivating window into her decades-long reign. From the moment of her ascension to the throne in 1952 at the age of twenty-five, Queen Elizabeth II was the object of unparalleled scrutiny. But through the fog of glamour and gossip, how well did we really know the world’s most famous monarch? Drawing on numerous interviews and never-before-revealed documents, acclaimed biographer Sally Bedell Smith pulls back the curtain to show in intimate detail the public and private lives of Queen Elizabeth II, who led her country and Commonwealth through the wars and upheavals of the last twentieth and twenty-first centuries with unparalleled composure, intelligence, and grace. In Elizabeth the Queen, we meet the young girl who suddenly becomes “heiress presumptive” when her uncle abdicates the throne. We meet the thirteen-year-old Lilibet as she falls in love with a young navy cadet named Philip and becomes determined to marry him, even though her parents prefer wealthier English aristocrats. We see the teenage Lilibet repairing army trucks during World War II and standing with Winston Churchill on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on V-E Day. We see the young Queen struggling to balance the demands of her job with her role as the mother of two young children. Sally Bedell Smith brings us inside the palace doors and into the Queen’s daily routines—the “red boxes” of documents she reviewed each day, the weekly meetings she had with twelve prime ministers, her physically demanding tours abroad, and the constant scrutiny of the press—as well as her personal relationships: with her husband, Prince Philip, the love of her life; her children and their often-disastrous marriages; her grandchildren and friends.",3

Bonhoeffer,Eric Metaxas,2011-08-29,Biography & Autobiography,"Who better to face the greatest evil of the 20th century than a humble man of faith? As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a pastor and author.

الأسماء الجغرافية – ذاكرة أجيال –,د. خليفة الرميثي,2022-11-30,History,المكان يمثل موجودًا اعتباريًا يعبّر عن موضع مادي، يكتسب هويته من طبيعة الأحداث أو الموجودات التي قامت حوله، ودراسة الأسماء الجغرافية ومدلولها تكشف عن معلومات تاريخية مهمة عن المكان عبر حقبة زمنية تشمل لغة وعادات اندثرت. تُشكِّل أسماء المواقع القديمة في الإمارات العربية المتحدة جزءًا من تراثها التاريخي والجغرافي، ومن الهوية الحضارية، وقد قضى على كثير منها الزحف العمراني وغابت عن الذاكرة المعاصرة. وفي هذا الكتاب تمكّن المؤلف من جَمع وتحقيق كثير من الأسماء الجغرافية، وتناول تاريخها وطبيعتها وعلاقتها بالبيئة المحيطة والتغيرات التي جرت على لفظها نتيجة وجود جنسيات أخرى من الذين يصعب عليهم نطق بعض الأسماء العربية، فحُوِّر الاسم أو لُحن النُّطق؛ لذا تحقق المؤلف من وجود الاسم الصحيح أولًا من عدمه، ثم من صحة نطقه وطريقة كتابته. وقد أجاب عن تساؤلات المرء: كيف ومتى سُمِّيَتِ الأماكن؟ ومَن الذي سمَّاها بهذه الأسماء؟ كما تناول بعض الأسس والضوابط المتبعة في تسمية الأماكن وطرق كتابة الأسماء بالعربية لغير الناطقين بها، كما استعرض بشيء من التفصيل أماكن تواجد السكان وأماكن الاستقرار القديمة في إمارة أبوظبي، والجزر الهامة المأهولة قديمًا، وبعض التجمعات السُّكَّانية البريَّة وطرق مواصلاتها. وأفرد فصلًا لزيادة التفصيل عن محاضر إليوا ونخيلها واستخرج إحصائيات مفصلَّة عن سكانها وعدد نخيلها، وختم الكتاب بوصف 1195 اسمًا وذكر أكثر من 3500 اسم جغرافي في شكل معجم مصغّر للأسماء الجغرافية بدولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة ووضَّح ذلك على خرائط. وفي هذه الدراسة استطاع أن يفرِّق بين أسماء الأمكنة المعروفة والمفقودة والصحيح والضعيف منها، واختار أقربها إلى الصحَّة وأبعدها عن الشك.,5
Fighter Pilot,"Christina Olds, Robin Olds, Ed Rasimus",2010-04-13,Biography & Autobiography,"Fighter Pilot is the memoir of legendary ace American fighter pilot and general officer in the U.S. Air Force, Robin Olds. Robin Olds was a larger-than-life hero with a towering personality. A graduate of West Point and an inductee in the National College Football Hall of Fame for his All-American performance for Army, Olds was one of the toughest college football players at the time. In WWII, Olds quickly became a top fighter pilot and squadron commander by the age of 22—and an ace with 12 aerial victories. But it was in Vietnam where the man became a legend. He arrived in 1966 to find a dejected group of pilots and motivated them by placing himself on the flight schedule under officers junior to himself, then challenging them to train him properly because he would soon be leading them. Proving he wasn't a WWII retread, he led the wing with aggressiveness, scoring another four confirmed kills, becoming a rare triple ace. Olds, who retired a brigadier general and died in 2007, was a unique individual whose personal story presents one of the most eagerly anticipated military books in recent memory.

The Great Mughals and their India,Dirk Collier,2016-03-01,History,"A definitive, comprehensive and engrossing chronicle of one of the greatest dynasties of the world – the Mughal – from its founder Babur to Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last of the clan. The magnificent Mughal legacy – the world-famous Taj Mahal being the most prominent among countless other examples – is an inexhaustible source of inspiration to historians, writers, moviemakers, artists and ordinary mortals alike. Mughal history abounds with all the ingredients of classical drama: ambition and frustration, hope and despair, grandeur and decline, love and hate, and loyalty and betrayal. In other words: it is great to read and offers ample food for thought on the human condition. Much more importantly, Mughal history deserves to be widely read and reflected upon, because of its lasting cultural and socio-political relevance to today’s world in general and the Indian subcontinent in particular. The Mughals have left us with a legacy that cannot be erased. With regard to the eventful reigns of Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb and their successors, crucial questions arise: Where did they succeed? Where did they fail? And more importantly, what should we learn from their triumphs and failures? The author believes that history books should be accurate, informative and entertaining. In The Great Mughals and Their India, he has kept these objectives in mind in an attempt to narrate Mughal history from their perspective. At the same time, he does not shy away from dealing with controversial issues. Here is a fascinating and riveting saga that brings alive a spectacular bygone era – authentically and convincingly.",1

John Adams,David McCullough,2001-05-22,Biography & Autobiography,"The Pulitzer Prize–winning, bestselling biography of America’s founding father and second president that was the basis for the acclaimed HBO series, brilliantly told by master historian David McCullough. In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second president of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as “out of his senses”; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. This is history on a grand scale—a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship, and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas.

Hit Refresh,"Satya Nadella, Greg Shaw, Jill Tracie Nichols",2017-09-26,Biography & Autobiography,"“At the core, Hit Refresh, is about us humans and the unique quality we call empathy, which will become ever more valuable in a world where the torrent of technology will disrupt the status quo like never before.” – Satya Nadella from Hit Refresh “Satya has charted a course for making the most of the opportunities created by technology while also facing up to the hard questions.” – Bill Gates from the Foreword of Hit Refresh The New York Times bestseller Hit Refresh is about individual change, about the transformation happening inside of Microsoft and the technology that will soon impact all of our lives—the arrival of the most exciting and disruptive wave of technology humankind has experienced: artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and quantum computing. It’s about how people, organizations, and societies can and must transform and “hit refresh” in their persistent quest for new energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal. Microsoft’s CEO tells the inside story of the company’s continuing transformation, tracing his own personal journey from a childhood in India to leading some of the most significant technological changes in the digital era. Satya Nadella explores a fascinating childhood before immigrating to the U.S. and how he learned to lead along the way. He then shares his meditations as a sitting CEO—one who is mostly unknown following the brainy Bill Gates and energetic Steve Ballmer. He tells the inside story of how a company rediscovered its soul—transforming everything from culture to their fiercely competitive landscape and industry partnerships. As much a humanist as engineer and executive, Nadella concludes with his vision for the coming wave of technology and by exploring the potential impact to society and delivering call to action for world leaders. “Ideas excite me,” Nadella explains. “Empathy grounds and centers me.” Hit Refresh is a set of reflections, meditations, and recommendations presented as algorithms from a principled, deliberative leader searching for improvement—for himself, for a storied company, and for society.",5
Japanese Visual Culture,Mark W. MacWilliams,2008-01-29,Art,"Born of Japan's cultural encounter with Western entertainment media, manga (comic books or graphic novels) and anime (animated films) are two of the most universally recognized forms of contemporary mass culture. Because they tell stories through visual imagery, they vault over language barriers. Well suited to electronic transmission and distributed by Japan's globalized culture industry, they have become a powerful force in both the mediascape and the marketplace. This volume brings together an international group of scholars from many specialties to probe the richness and subtleties of these deceptively simple cultural forms. The contributors explore the historical, cultural, sociological, and religious dimensions of manga and anime, and examine specific sub-genres, artists, and stylistics. The book also addresses such topics as spirituality, the use of visual culture by Japanese new religious movements, Japanese Goth, nostalgia and Japanese pop, comics for girls, and more. With illustrations throughout, it is a rich source for all scholars and fans of manga and anime as well as students of contemporary mass culture or Japanese culture and civilization.",5

臺灣當代傳記文學?究,鄭尊仁,2003-11-01,Biography,本書以文學觀點審視台灣當代傳記，為深陷於歷史或文學爭論之中而不受重視的當代白話傳記文學，提供了新的認知觀點與研究方向。 傳記文學源遠流長，但以白話文寫作的傳記寫作成熟較晚，所以它能夠融合中西傳統， 吸收各種寫作技巧，展現完全不同的風貌。 在台灣地區，自政府播遷來台後，傳記一直呈現穩定的成長。解嚴之後，更由於禁忌的消失，使傳記如雨後春筍般蓬勃發展。然而中文學界對白話傳記文學，卻始終未給予應有的重視。長久以來，中文學界花了許多時間與精神在研究古代傳記，可是對現代的新體傳記漠不關心。 另一方面來說，我們除了要面對來自其他學科的壓力之外，還必須正視台灣在國際上的發言權問題。翻開國外研究傳記的學術刊物，例如美國夏威夷大學所發行的《傳記》研究季刊，會發現只要提到中國現代的白話傳記，便完全以大陸的觀點為主。例如傳記發展的社會背景，傳記的作家與作品等。而台灣地區則似乎毫無疑義地屬於「中國」這個大範圍，並且理所當然地隸屬於同一個發展系統之中，但實際上絕非如此。我們並沒有三反五反，也沒有文化大革命。可是我們有日據時代、有二二八事變、有總統選舉。我們有自己的發展軌跡，與大陸完全不可以混為一談。可是國外學者並不了解，其原因便是中國大陸的學者較早留心於此，而且在國際上發表論文。反觀台灣卻一直沒有起步，目前就算是史學界也還沒有人在台灣的白話傳記發展上做過研究。【秀威資訊科技股份有限公司製作】,5
Dual-Process Theories in Moral Psychology,Cordula Brand,2016-03-21,Philosophy,"This anthology offers a unique collection of contributions focusing on the discussion about the so-called dual-process theories within the field of moral psychology. In general, dual-process theories state that in cognitive systems, two sorts of processes can be differentiated: an affective, associative process and an analytical, rule-based process. This distinction recently entered the debate on the relationship between intuitive and rational approaches to explaining the phenomenon of moral judgment. The increasing interest in these theories raises questions concerning their general impact on social contexts. The anthology aims at presenting stepping-stones of an analysis of the merits and drawbacks of this development. For that purpose, the authors discuss general questions concerning the relationship between ethics and empirical sciences, methodological questions, reassessments of established terminology and societal implications of dual-process theories in moral psychology.",5

Psychology and Philosophy,"Sara Heinämaa, Martina Reuter",2008-10-17,Philosophy,"Psychology and Philosophy provides a history of the relations between philosophy and the science of psychology from late scholasticism to contemporary discussions. The book covers the development from 16th-century interpretations of Aristotle’s De Anima, through Kantianism and the 19th-century revival of Aristotelianism, up to 20th-century phenomenological and analytic studies of consciousness and the mind. In this volume historically divergent conceptions of psychology as a science receive special emphasis. The volume illuminates the particular nature of studies of the psyche in the contexts of Aristotelian and Cartesian as well as 19th- and 20th-century science and philosophy. The relations between metaphysics, transcendental philosophy, and natural science are studied in the works of Kant, Brentano, Bergson, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Wittgenstein, and Davidson. Accounts of less known philosophers, such as Trendelenburg and Maine de Biran, throw new light on the history of the field. Discussions concerning the connections between moral philosophy and philosophical psychology broaden the volume’s perspective and show new directions for development. All contributions are based on novel research in their respective fields. The collection provides materials for researchers and graduate students in the fields of philosophy of mind, history of philosophy, and psychology.",5
The Art and Science of Trauma and the Autobiographical,Meg Jensen,2019-01-04,Literary Criticism,"This book examines posttraumatic autobiographical projects, elucidating the complex relationship between the ‘science of trauma’ (and how that idea is understood across various scientific disciplines), and the rhetorical strategies of fragmentation, dissociation, reticence and repetitive troping widely used the representation of traumatic experience. From autobiographical fictions to prison poems, from witness testimony to autography, and from testimonio to war memorials, otherwise dissimilar projects speak of past suffering through a limited and even predictable discourse in search of healing. Drawing on approaches from literary, human rights and cultural studies that highlight relations between trauma, language, meaning and self-hood, and the latest research on the science of trauma from the fields of clinical, behavioral and evolutionary psychology and neuroscience, I read such autobiographical projects not as ‘symptoms’ but as complex interrogative negotiations of trauma and its aftermath: commemorative and performative narratives navigating aesthetic, biological, cultural, linguistic and emotional pressure and inspiration.",5

Metaphors We Live By,"George Lakoff, Mark Johnson",2008-12-19,Philosophy,"The now-classic Metaphors We Live By changed our understanding of metaphor and its role in language and the mind. Metaphor, the authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects. Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are ""metaphors we live by""—metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them. In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.",5

The Heart of Islam,Seyyed Hossein Nasr,2009-03-17,Religion,"As the specter of religious extremism has become a fact of life today, the temptation is great to allow the evil actions and perspectives of a minority to represent an entire tradition. In the case of Islam, there has been much recent confusion in the Western world centered on distorted portrayals of its core values. Born of ignorance, such confusion feeds the very problem at hand. In The Heart of Islam one of the great intellectual figures in Islamic history offers a timely presentation of the core spiritual and social values of Islam: peace, compassion, social justice, and respect for the other. Seizing this unique moment in history to reflect on the essence of his tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr seeks to ""open a spiritual and intellectual space for mutual understanding."" Exploring Islamic values in scripture, traditional sources, and history, he also shows their clear counterparts in the Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing the common ground of the Abrahamic faiths. Nasr challenges members of the world's civilizations to stop demonizing others while identifying themselves with pure goodness and to turn instead to a deeper understanding of those shared values that can solve the acute problems facing humanity today. ""Muslims must ask themselves what went wrong within their own societies,"" he writes, ""but the West must also pose the same question about itself . . . whether we are Muslims, Jews, Christians, or even secularists, whether we live in the Islamic world or in the West, we are in need of meaning in our lives, of ethical norms to guide our actions, of a vision that would allow us to live at peace with each other and with the rest of God's creation."" Such help, he believes, lies at the heart of every religion and can lead the followers of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well as other religious and spiritual traditions to a new future of mutual respect and common global purpose. The Heart of Islam is a landmark presentation of enduring value that offers hope to humanity, and a compelling portrait of the beauty and appeal of the faith of 1.2 billion people.",3.5
Poetics,Aristotle,2013-01-10,Poetry,"'What is poetry, how many kinds of it are there, and what are their specific effects?' Aristotle's Poetics is the most influential book on poetry ever written. A founding text of European aesthetics and literary criticism, from it stems much of our modern understanding of the creation and impact of imaginative writing, including poetry, drama, and fiction. For Aristotle, the art of representation conveys universal truths which we can appreciate more easily than the lessons of history or philosophy. In his short treatise Aristotle discusses the origins of poetry and its early development, the nature of tragedy and plot, and offers practical advice to playwrights. This new translation by Anthony Kenny is accompanied by associated material from Plato and a range of responses from more modern literary practitioners: Sir Philip Sidney, P. B. Shelley, and Dorothy L. Sayers. The book includes a wide-ranging introduction and notes, making this the most accessible and attractive modern edition. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",5
The Problems of Philosophy,Bertrand Russell,2007-01-01,Philosophy,"One of his great works, and a must-read for any student of philosophy, The Problems of Philosophy was written in 1912 as an introduction to Russell's thought. As an empiricist, Russell starts at the beginning with this question: Is there any knowledge in the world that is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? This, according to Russell, is where the work of philosophy begins. He covers topics such as reality, the nature of matter, inductive reasoning, truth, and the limits of philosophical knowledge. As one of the greatest minds in Western philosophy, Russell's thoughts are profoundly informative and provocative and suitable for anyone wishing to expand his mind. British philosopher and mathematician BERTRAND ARTHUR WILLIAM RUSSELL (1872-1970) won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. Among his many works are Why I Am Not a Christian (1927), Power: A New Social Analysis (1938), and My Philosophical Development (1959).",3
"Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto",His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada,1972-12-31,Philosophy,"Srimad-Bhagavatam, an epic philosophical and literary classic, holds a prominent position in India's voluminous written wisdom. The timeless wisdom of India is expressed in the Vedas, ancient Sanskrit texts that touches upon all fields of human knowledge. Originally preserved through oral tradition, the Vedas were first put into writing by Srila Vyasadeva, the ""literary incarnation of God."" After compiling the Vedas, Srila Vyasadeva was inspired by his spiritual master to present their profound essence in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Known as ""the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic literature,"" Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most complete and authoritative exposition of Vedic knowledge. After writing the Bhagavatam, Vyasa taught it to his son, Shukadeva Goswami, who later spoke the Bhagavatam to Maharaja Parikshit in an assembly of sages on the bank of the sacred Ganges River. Although Maharaja Parikshit was a great rajarshi (saintly king) and the emperor of the world, when he received notice of his death seven days in advance, he renounced his entire kingdom and retired to the bank of the Ganges to seek spiritual enlightenment. The questions of King Parikshit and Shukadeva Goswami's illuminating answers, concerning everything from the nature of the self to the origin of the universe, are the basis of Srimad-Bhagavatam. This edition of Bhagavatam is the only complete English translation with an elaborate and scholarly commentary, and it is the first edition widely available to the English-reading public. This work is the product of the scholarly and devotional effort of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the world's most distinguished teacher of Indian religious and philosophical thought. His Sanskrit scholarship and intimate familiarity with Vedic culture combine to reveal to the West a magnificent exposition of this important classic.",5

Inner Engineering,Sadhguru,2016-09-20,"Body, Mind & Spirit","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Thought leader, visionary, philanthropist, mystic, and yogi Sadhguru presents Western readers with a time-tested path to achieving absolute well-being: the classical science of yoga. “A loving invitation to live our best lives and a profound reassurance of why and how we can.”—Sir Ken Robinson, author of The Element, Finding Your Element, and Out of Our Minds: Learning to Be Creative NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY SPIRITUALITY & HEALTH The practice of hatha yoga, as we commonly know it, is but one of eight branches of the body of knowledge that is yoga. In fact, yoga is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy. A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening, from a boy with an unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time stood still and he emerged radically changed. Today, as the founder of Isha, an organization devoted to humanitarian causes, he lights the path for millions. The term guru, he notes, means “dispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you. . . . As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life.” The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new. Inner Engineering presents a revolutionary way of thinking about our agency and our humanity and the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.",5
The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi,Mahatma Gandhi,2010-06-15,Religion,"Regarded in India as one of the most important books of the 20th century, Gandhi’s commentary on this classic Hindu text addresses the issues he felt most directly affected the spiritual lives of common people. The Bhagavad Gita, also called The Song of the Lord, is a 700-line section of a much longer Sanskrit war epic, the Mahabharata, about the legendary conflict between two branches of an Indian ruling family. Framed as a conversation between Krishna, an incarnation of the god Vishnu, and a general of one of the armies, the Gita is written in powerful poetic language meant to be chanted. Equally treasured as a guide to action, a devotional scripture, a philosophical text, and inspirational reading, it remains one of the world’s most influential, widely read spiritual books. The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi is based on talks given by Gandhi between February and November 1926 at the Satyagraha Ashram in Ahmedabad, India. During this time—a period when Gandhi had withdrawn from mass political activity—he devoted much of his time and energy to translating the Gita from Sanskrit into his native Gujarati. As a result, he met with his followers almost daily, after morning prayer sessions, to discuss the Gita’s contents and meaning as it unfolded before him. This book is the transcription of those daily sessions.",5

The Philosophy of Stanley Kubrick,Jerold Abrams,2007-05-04,Performing Arts,"In the course of fifty years, director Stanley Kubrick produced some of the most haunting and indelible images on film. His films touch on a wide range of topics rife with questions about human life, behavior, and emotions: love and sex, war, crime, madness, social conditioning, and technology. Within this great variety of subject matter, Kubrick examines different sides of reality and unifies them into a rich philosophical vision that is similar to existentialism. Perhaps more than any other philosophical concept, existentialism—the belief that philosophical truth has meaning only if it is chosen by the individual—has come down from the ivory tower to influence popular culture at large. In virtually all of Kubrick’s films, the protagonist finds himself or herself in opposition to a hard and uncaring world, whether the conflict arises in the natural world or in human institutions. Kubrick’s war films (Fear and Desire, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, and Full Metal Jacket) examine how humans deal with their worst fears—especially the fear of death—when facing the absurdity of war. Full Metal Jacket portrays a world of physical and moral change, with an environment in continual flux in which attempting to impose order can be dangerous. The film explores the tragic consequences of an unbending moral code in a constantly changing universe. Essays in the volume examine Kubrick’s interest in morality and fate, revealing a Stoic philosophy at the center of many of his films. Several of the contributors find his oeuvre to be characterized by skepticism, irony, and unfettered hedonism. In such films as A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick confronts the notion that we will struggle against our own scientific and technological innovations. Kubrick’s films about the future posit that an active form of nihilism will allow humans to accept the emptiness of the world and push beyond it to form a free and creative view of humanity. Taken together, the essays in The Philosophy of Stanley Kubrick are an engaging look at the director’s stark vision of a constantly changing moral and physical universe. They promise to add depth and complexity to the interpretation of Kubrick’s signature films.",3

The Adapted Mind,"Jerome H. Barkow, Leda Cosmides, John Tooby",1995-10-19,Science,"Although researchers have long been aware that the species-typical architecture of the human mind is the product of our evolutionary history, it has only been in the last three decades that advances in such fields as evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, and paleoanthropology have made the fact of our evolution illuminating. Converging findings from a variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface of expressed cultural variability. Second, this collection of cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the adaptive problems regularly faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors--problems such as mate selection, language acquisition, cooperation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently, the traditional view of the mind as a general-purpose computer, tabula rasa, or passive recipient of culture is being replaced by the view that the mind resembles an intricate network of functionally specialized computers, each of which imposes contentful structure on human mental organization and culture. The Adapted Mind explores this new approach--evolutionary psychology--and its implications for a new view of culture.",5
The Road Less Traveled,M. Scott Peck,2012-03-13,Self-Help,"Now featuring a new introduction by Dr. M. Scott Peck, the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the classic bestseller The Road Less Traveled, celebrated by The Washington Post as “not just a book but a spontaneous act of generosity.” Perhaps no book in this generation has had a more profound impact on our intellectual and spiritual lives than The Road Less Traveled.

Recognizing that, as in the famous opening line of his book, “Life is difficult” and that the journey to spiritual growth is a long one, Dr. Peck never bullies his readers, but rather guides them gently through the hard and often painful process of change toward a higher level of self-understanding.",4

Crazy Like Us,Ethan Watters,2010-01-12,Psychology,"“A blistering and truly original work of reporting and analysis, uncovering America’s role in homogenizing how the world defines wellness and healing” (Po Bronson). In Crazy Like Us, Ethan Watters reveals that the most devastating consequence of the spread of American culture has not been our golden arches or our bomb craters but our bulldozing of the human psyche itself: We are in the process of homogenizing the way the world goes mad. It is well known that American culture is a dominant force at home and abroad; our exportation of everything from movies to junk food is a well-documented phenomenon. But is it possible America's most troubling impact on the globalizing world has yet to be accounted for? American-style depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anorexia have begun to spread around the world like contagions, and the virus is us. Traveling from Hong Kong to Sri Lanka to Zanzibar to Japan, acclaimed journalist Ethan Watters witnesses firsthand how Western healers often steamroll indigenous expressions of mental health and madness and replace them with our own. In teaching the rest of the world to think like us, we have been homogenizing the way the world goes mad.",3

Social Support Measurement and Intervention,"Sheldon Cohen, Lynn G. Underwood, Benjamin H. Gottlieb",2000-10-19,Social Science,"Surgery and pharmaceuticals are not the only effective procedures we have to improve our health. The natural human tendency to care for fellow humans, to support them with social networks, has proven to be a powerful treatment as well. As a result, the areas of application for social support intervention have expanded dramatically during the past 20 years. As these areas have expanded, so too has the literature on the theory and measurement of social support. Yet, the literature has focussed on very particular areas. Investigators in the social sciences have mainly focused on the protection that social support confers in the context of stressful life events and transitions, whereas studies in the health sciences have concentrated on the effects of social networks and supports on population mortality and morbidity. Although no single theoretical framework has been widely accepted, there is consensus that both the psychological sense of support and actual expressions of support play critical roles in maintaining health and well being. This book is a state-of-the-art resource for the selection and development of strategies for social support assessment and intervention. Designed for use by behavioral and medical scientists conducting studies of physical illness, psychological adjustment, and psychiatric illness in human populations, this volume presents a broad conceptual framework addressing the role of social support in mental and physical health. The book is divided into four sections. The first provides some historical context as well as a conceptual overview of how social support might influence mental and physical health. The second discusses techniques for measuring social networks and support, and the third addresses the design of different types of support interventions. The final section presents some general comments on the volume and its implications for social support research and intervention. This resource is meant to aid researchers in understanding the conceptual criteria on which measurement and intervention decisions should be made when studying the relations between social support and health. Furthermore, the information provided on both measurement and intervention will be valuable to practitioners interested in designing and evaluating prevention and treatment initiatives. Sponsored by the Fetzer Institute as a follow up to their successful 1995 publication, Measuring Stress, this book will provide the most up to date research on the effects of social support interventions on physical and mental health.",5
"Good Habits, Bad Habits",Wendy Wood,2019-10-01,Science,"A landmark book about how we form habits, and what we can do with this knowledge to make positive change We spend a shocking 43 percent of our day doing things without thinking about them. That means that almost half of our actions aren’t conscious choices but the result of our non-conscious mind nudging our body to act along learned behaviors. How we respond to the people around us; the way we conduct ourselves in a meeting; what we buy; when and how we exercise, eat, and drink—a truly remarkable number of things we do every day, regardless of their complexity, operate outside of our awareness. We do them automatically. We do them by habit. And yet, whenever we want to change something about ourselves, we rely on willpower. We keep turning to our conscious selves, hoping that our determination and intention will be enough to effect positive change. And that is why almost all of us fail. But what if you could harness the extraordinary power of your unconscious mind, which already determines so much of what you do, to truly reach your goals? Wendy Wood draws on three decades of original research to explain the fascinating science of how we form habits, and offers the key to unlocking our habitual mind in order to make the changes we seek. A potent mix of neuroscience, case studies, and experiments conducted in her lab, Good Habits, Bad Habits is a comprehensive, accessible, and above all deeply practical book that will change the way you think about almost every aspect of your life. By explaining how our brains are wired to respond to rewards, receive cues from our surroundings, and shut down when faced with too much friction, Wood skillfully dissects habit formation, demonstrating how we can take advantage of this knowledge to form better habits. Her clear and incisive work shows why willpower alone is woefully inadequate when we’re working toward building the life we truly want, and offers real hope for those who want to make positive change.",5

Originals,Adam Grant,2016-02-02,Business & Economics,"The #1 New York Times bestseller that examines how people can champion new ideas in their careers and everyday life—and how leaders can fight groupthink, from the author of Hidden Potential, Think Again, and the co-author of Option B “Filled with fresh insights on a broad array of topics that are important to our personal and professional lives.”—The New York Times DealBook “Originals is one of the most important and captivating books I have ever read, full of surprising and powerful ideas. It will not only change the way you see the world; it might just change the way you live your life. And it could very well inspire you to change your world.” —Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and author of Lean In With Give and Take, Adam Grant not only introduced a landmark new paradigm for success but also established himself as one of his generation’s most compelling and provocative thought leaders. In Originals he again addresses the challenge of improving the world, but now from the perspective of becoming original: choosing to champion novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battle conformity, and buck outdated traditions. How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all? Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting-room floor. The payoff is a set of groundbreaking insights about rejecting conformity and improving the status quo.",5
The Anatomy of Violence,Adrian Raine,2013-04-30,Social Science,"With a 4-page full-color insert, and black-and-white illustrations throughout Why do some innocent kids grow up to become cold-blooded serial killers? Is bad biology partly to blame? For more than three decades Adrian Raine has been researching the biological roots of violence and establishing neurocriminology, a new field that applies neuroscience techniques to investigate the causes and cures of crime. In The Anatomy of Violence, Raine dissects the criminal mind with a fascinating, readable, and far-reaching scientific journey into the body of evidence that reveals the brain to be a key culprit in crime causation. Raine documents from genetic research that the seeds of sin are sown early in life, giving rise to abnormal physiological functioning that cultivates crime. Drawing on classical case studies of well-known killers in history—including Richard Speck, Ted Kaczynski, and Henry Lee Lucas—Raine illustrates how impairments to brain areas controlling our ability to experience fear, make good decisions, and feel guilt predispose us to violence. He contends that killers can actually be coldhearted: something as simple as a low resting heart rate can give rise to violence. But arguing that biology is not destiny, he also sketches out provocative new biosocial treatment approaches that can change the brain and prevent violence. Finally, Raine tackles the thorny legal and ethical dilemmas posed by his research, visualizing a futuristic brave new world where our increasing ability to identify violent offenders early in life might shape crime-prevention policies, for good and bad. Will we sacrifice our notions of privacy and civil rights to identify children as potential killers in the hopes of helping both offenders and victims? How should we punish individuals with little to no control over their violent behavior? And should parenting require a license? The Anatomy of Violence offers a revolutionary appraisal of our understanding of criminal offending, while also raising provocative questions that challenge our core human values of free will, responsibility, and punishment.",5

Sustentabilidad y psicología positiva,Victor Corral Verdugo,2012-08-05,Psychology,"Un buen número de expertos en el estudio de las conductas protectoras del ambiente considera que dichas conductas implican molestia, sacrificio y displacer a las personas que las practican. Es decir, las consecuencias psicológicas que produce el cuidar los recursos naturales y a otras personas son de naturaleza negativa. Otros autores señalan que emociones también negativas como la culpa, la indignación, la vergüenza y el miedo se asocian a un esfuerzo insuficiente de protección ambiental, lo que impulsa a las personas a involucrarse en el cuidado ambiental. El presente libro cuestiona la pertinencia y alcance de las explicaciones del comportamiento proambiental basadas en la negatividad. A través de un recuento de estudios y marcos explicativos el texto demuestra que hay más positividad psicológica en los actos proecológicos y prosociales que lo que cualquiera podría imaginarse. Consecuentemente, el autor aborda el concepto de conductas sustentables como el conjunto de prácticas positivas (es decir, valoradas favorablemente) que tienen como antecedentes procesos psicológicos positivos y que repercuten en beneficios psicológicos para las personas que se comportan con una orientación prosustentable. Entre los beneficios que acarrea el ser proambiental se encuentran la restauración psicológica, la motivación intrínseca, el bienestar psicológico y la felicidad. La obra concluye, por lo tanto, que existe, en la aproximación psicológica positiva de la sustentabilidad, una buena dosis de esperanza para lograr cambiar los estilos de vida antiambientales que ahora prevalecen por otros más proecológicos y prosociales.",5

The Thriving Adolescent,"Louise L. Hayes, Joseph V. Ciarrochi",2015-11-01,Psychology,"Adolescents face unique pressures and worries. Will they pass high school? Should they go to college? Will they find love? And what ways do they want to act in the world? The uncertainty surrounding the future can be overwhelming. Sadly, and all too often, if things don’t go smoothly, adolescents will begin labeling themselves as losers, unpopular, unattractive, weird, or dumb. And, let’s not forget the ubiquitous ‘not good enough’ story that often begins during these formative years. These labels are often carried forward throughout life. So what can you do, now, to help lighten this lifelong burden? The Thriving Adolescent offers teachers, counselors, and mental health professionals powerful techniques for working with adolescents. Based in proven- effective acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), the skills and tips outlined in this book will help adolescents and teens manage difficult emotions, connect with their values, achieve mindfulness and vitality, and develop positive relationships with friends and family. The evidence-based practices in this book focus on developing a strong sense of self, and will give adolescents the confidence they need to make that difficult transition into adulthood. Whether it’s school, family, or friend related, adolescents experience a profound level of stress, and often they lack the psychological tools to deal with stress in productive ways. The skills we impart to them now will help set the stage for a happy, healthy adulthood. If you work with adolescents or teens, this is a must-have addition to your professional library.",5
Barking Up the Wrong Tree,Eric Barker,2017-05-16,Business & Economics,"Wall Street Journal Bestseller Much of the advice we’ve been told about achievement is logical, earnest…and downright wrong. In Barking Up the Wrong Tree, Eric Barker reveals the extraordinary science behind what actually determines success and most importantly, how anyone can achieve it. You’ll learn: • Why valedictorians rarely become millionaires, and how your biggest weakness might actually be your greatest strength • Whether nice guys finish last and why the best lessons about cooperation come from gang members, pirates, and serial killers • Why trying to increase confidence fails and how Buddhist philosophy holds a superior solution • The secret ingredient to “grit” that Navy SEALs and disaster survivors leverage to keep going • How to find work-life balance using the strategy of Genghis Khan, the errors of Albert Einstein, and a little lesson from Spider-Man By looking at what separates the extremely successful from the rest of us, we learn what we can do to be more like them—and find out in some cases why it’s good that we aren’t. Barking Up the Wrong Tree draws on startling statistics and surprising anecdotes to help you understand what works and what doesn’t so you can stop guessing at success and start living the life you want.",2

How to Love the Empty Air,Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz,2018-05-07,Poetry,"New York Times bestselling nonfiction writer and poet Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz’s How to Love the Empty Air reaches new heights in her revelatory seventh collection of poetry. Continuing in her tradition of engaging autobiographical work, How to Love the Empty Air explores what happens when the impossible becomes real?for better and for worse. Aptowicz’s journey to find happiness and home in her ever-shifting world sees her struggling in cities throughout America. When her luck changes?in love and in life?she can’t help but “tell the sun / tell the fields / tell the huge Texas sky.... / tell myself again and again until I believe it.” However, the upward trajectory of this new life is rocked by the sudden death of the poet’s mother. In the year that follows, Aptowicz battles the silencing power of grief with intimate poems burnished by loss and a hard-won humor, capturing the dance that all newly grieving must do between everyday living and the desire “to elope with this grief, / who is not your enemy, / this grief who maybe now is your best friend. / This grief, who is your husband, / the thing you curl into every night, / falling asleep in its arms...” As in her award-winning The Year of No Mistakes, Aptowicz counts her losses and her blessings, knowing how despite it all, life “ripples boundless, like electricity, like joy / like... laughter, irresistible and bright, / an impossible thing to contain.”",3

Poetics,Aristotle,2013-01-10,Poetry,"'What is poetry, how many kinds of it are there, and what are their specific effects?' Aristotle's Poetics is the most influential book on poetry ever written. A founding text of European aesthetics and literary criticism, from it stems much of our modern understanding of the creation and impact of imaginative writing, including poetry, drama, and fiction. For Aristotle, the art of representation conveys universal truths which we can appreciate more easily than the lessons of history or philosophy. In his short treatise Aristotle discusses the origins of poetry and its early development, the nature of tragedy and plot, and offers practical advice to playwrights. This new translation by Anthony Kenny is accompanied by associated material from Plato and a range of responses from more modern literary practitioners: Sir Philip Sidney, P. B. Shelley, and Dorothy L. Sayers. The book includes a wide-ranging introduction and notes, making this the most accessible and attractive modern edition.

Bashō's Haiku,Matsuo Bashō,2012-02-01,Religion,"2005 CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title Basho's Haiku offers the most comprehensive translation yet of the poetry of Japanese writer Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694), who is credited with perfecting and popularizing the haiku form of poetry. One of the most widely read Japanese writers, both within his own country and worldwide, Bashō is especially beloved by those who appreciate nature and those who practice Zen Buddhism. Born into the samurai class, Bashō rejected that world after the death of his master and became a wandering poet and teacher. During his travels across Japan, he became a lay Zen monk and studied history and classical poetry. His poems contained a mystical quality and expressed universal themes through simple images from the natural world. David Landis Barnhill's brilliant book strives for literal translations of Bashō's work, arranged chronologically in order to show Bashō's development as a writer. Avoiding wordy and explanatory translations, Barnhill captures the brevity and vitality of the original Japanese, letting the images suggest the depth of meaning involved. Barnhill also presents an overview of haiku poetry and analyzes the significance of nature in this literary form, while suggesting the importance of Bashō to contemporary American literature and environmental thought.",5

The holding company and corporate control,Herman P. Daems,2012-12-06,Business & Economics,"1. Research subject and objectives This study focuses on an economic institution, the large industrial holding company, which continues to hold a prominent if not a strategic position in the resource allocation process in many industrialised market economies. Powerful multicompany combines like the famous Japanese zaibatsu and the less familiar but equally powerful European industrial groups rely on the institution of the holding company to tie their intermarket control network together. Two general questions arise from this situation: first, what factors account for the viability and growth within a market setting of those institutions which internalise allocation decisions and, second, what effect do such institutions have on resource allocation? These questions provide the framework in which the proper research subject can be most adequately introduced. Before doing so, it is crucial to point out that the holding company institution, as analyzed in subsequent chapters, should not be confounded with the legal constructs, bearing the same generic name and flourishing in fiscal paradises, whose sole function is to organise tax evasion across national boundaries. The institution, as studied here, is the large holding company through which industrial groups manage multicompany systems. Such multicompany systems, operating an intermarket network by means of holding companies, continue to be more typical for Europe and Japan than for the United States where, for legal reasons, but also because of managerial efficiency, the multicompany system built around the holding company institution was rather short-lived and 1 the giant integrated multiunit enterprise rose to dominance instead.",5
Blockchain and Crypto Currency,"Makoto Yano, Chris Dai, Kenichi Masuda, Yoshio Kishimoto",2020-04-15,Business & Economics,"This open access book contributes to the creation of a cyber ecosystem supported by blockchain technology in which technology and people can coexist in harmony. Blockchains have shown that trusted records, or ledgers, of permanent data can be stored on the Internet in a decentralized manner. The decentralization of the recording process is expected to significantly economize the cost of transactions. Creating a ledger on data, a blockchain makes it possible to designate the owner of each piece of data, to trade data pieces, and to market them. This book examines the formation of markets for various types of data from the theory of market quality proposed and developed by M. Yano. Blockchains are expected to give data itself the status of a new production factor. Bringing ownership of data to the hands of data producers, blockchains can reduce the possibility of information leakage, enhance the sharing and use of IoT data, and prevent data monopoly and misuse. The industry will have a bright future as soon as better technology is developed and when a healthy infrastructure is created to support the blockchain market.",5

Constructing Leadership 4.0,Richard Kelly,2018-11-27,Business & Economics,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution signals a sea change in the way we lead our organisations. Moving away from relational leadership and horizontal, organisationally-led development, it is imperative that business leaders are able to adapt to more networked organisations and shift away from dated assumptions of positional power. Constructing Leadership 4.0 breaks new ground by explaining the urgent challenges facing managers and business leaders. It will teach you how to: Approach leadership development as a system rather than a programme Develop an organisational ecosystem to support leadership 4.0 Build collaborative networks Cultivate a responsive mindset through sensemaking Use non-classroom based learning methodologies for educating leaders Rooted in leadership development methodology and underpinned by cutting-edge research, this book calls for businesses to cultivate responsive leaders through a theory of connectivism and swarm intelligence that reflects the coming cybernetic revolution.",4
Beat the Crisis: 33 Quick Solutions for Your Company,Hermann Simon,2010-03-11,Business & Economics,"Newspaper columns blare the news daily. There is no doubt that we are struggling through a worldwide economic and financial crisis of a magnitude not witnessed since the Great Depression. In this environment, fraught with danger, no company can afford to take a wait-and-see attitude. One hesitation or misstep can result in the rapid demise of a once stalwart enterprise. Even small miscalculations can topple mighty empires; consider the U.S. auto industry, for example. The severity of the crisis demands that your company understand its causes, diagnose carefully, implement decisively and monitor constantly. However, the crisis also creates chances for companies that learn to assess risk, recognize opportunity and take action quickly. This book is an antidote to the chorus of doom-and-gloom, a manual for business leaders and employees who are ready to fight. In Beat the Crisis, international strategy guru, Hermann Simon, offers 33 practical actions that any company can take immediately. Organized into broad categories—""Changing Customer Needs,"" ""Sales and the Sales Force,"" ""Managing Offers and Prices"" and ""Services""—Simon shows companies how to focus on the areas where emphatic action can have quick and maximum impact on corporate performance. Drawing from dozens of successful cases around the world, Simon helps readers learn to read the market signals, develop quick solutions, and stay a step ahead of their competitors, while avoiding the pitfalls looming in the crisis. A concluding chapter looks beyond the crisis and considers the longer-term socio-political and business consequences, in which Simon foresees a new era of restraint.",5

Battle for the American Mind,"Pete Hegseth, David Goodwin",2022-06-14,Political Science,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER! President Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has written a revolutionary road map to saving our children from leftist indoctrination. Behind a smokescreen of “preparing students for the new industrial economy,” early progressives had political control in mind. America’s original schools didn’t just make kids memorize facts or learn skills; they taught them to think freely and arrive at wisdom. They assigned the classics, inspired love of God and country, and raised future citizens that changed the world forever. Today, after 16,000 hours of K-12 indoctrination, our kids come out of government schools hating America. They roll their eyes at religion and disdain our history. We spend more money on education than ever, but kids can barely read and write—let alone reason with discernment. Western culture is on the ropes. Kids are bored and aimless, flailing for purpose in a system that says racial and gender identity is everything. Battle for the American Mind is the untold story of the Progressive plan to neutralize the basis of our Republic – by removing the one ingredient that had sustained Western Civilization for thousands of years. Pete Hegseth and David Goodwin explain why, no matter what political skirmishes conservatives win, progressives are winning the war—and control the “supply lines” of future citizens. Reversing this reality will require parents to radically reorient their children’s education; even most homeschooling and Christian schooling are infused with progressive assumptions. We need to recover a lost philosophy of education – grounded in virtue and excellence – that can arm future generations to fight for freedom. It’s called classical Christian education. Never heard of it? You’re not alone. Battle for the American Mind is more than a book; it’s a field guide for remaking school in the United States. We’ve ceded our kids’ minds to the left for far too long—this book gives patriotic parents the ammunition to join an insurgency that gives America a fighting chance. Whether you're a conservative looking to push back against the progressive agenda or simply someone who cares about the education of our children, this book is for you.",2

Ancient Rome,Paul A. Zoch,2012-11-28,History,"The events and personalities of ancient Rome spring to life in this history, from its founding in 753 B.C. to the death of the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius in A.D. 180. Paul A. Zoch presents, in contemporary language, the history of Rome and the stories of its protagonists?such as Romulus and Remus, Horatius, and Nero-which are so often omitted from more specialized studies. With an eye detail, Zoch guides his readers through the military campaigns and political developments that shaped Rome’s rise from a small Italian city to the greatest imperial power the world had ever known. We witness the long struggle against the enemy city of Carthage. We follow Caesar as he campaigns in Britain, and we observe the ebb and flow of Rome’s fortunes in the Hellenistic East. Writing with the belief that such stories contain moral lessons that are relevant today, Zoch presents a narrative that is both entertaining and informative. An afterword takes the history to the fall of the Roman Empire in the West in A.D. 476.",5

Caveman Chemistry,Kevin M. Dunn,2003,Education,"Half a million years ago our ancestors learned to make fire from scratch. They crafted intricate tools from stone and brewed mind-altering elixirs from honey. Their descendants transformed clay into pottery, wool into clothing, and ashes into cleansers. In ceramic crucibles they won metal from rock, the metals lead to colored glazes and glass. Buildings of brick and mortar enshrined books of parchment and paper. Kings and queens demanded ever more colorful clothing and accessories in order to out-class clod-hoppers and call-girls. Kingdoms rose and fell by the power of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal. And the demands of everyday folk for glass and paper and soap stimulated the first round of chemical industrialization. From sulfuric acid to sodium carbonate. From aniline dyes to analgesic drugs. From blasting powder to fertilizers and plastics. In a phrase, From Caveman to Chemist. Your guides on this journey are the four alchemical elements; Fire, Earth, Air and Water. These archetypical characters deliver first-hand accounts of the births of their respective technologies. The spirit of Fire, for example, was born in the first creature to cultivate the flame. This spirit passed from one person to another, from one generation to another, from one millennium to another, arriving at last in the pages of this book. The spirit of Earth taught folks to make tools of stone, the spirit of Air imparted knowledge of units and the spirit of Water began with the invention of spirits. Having traveled the world from age to age, who can say where they will find their next home? Perhaps they will find one in you.",4.5

ESKİ TÜRKÇE SÖZLÜK,"Prof. Dr. FUZULİ BAYAT , Dr. MİNARA ESEN ALİYEVA",2009,Education,"Türk milleti dünyanın en zengin kültürüne sahip olduğu gibi en zengin diline de sahiptir. Ancak daha eski çağların dil verileri ne yazık ki, yazılı vesikalara aktarılmamış, karanlık dönem olarak kalmıştır. O bakımdan Türkçenin Altay veya Proto-Türk devri hakkında bilgimiz sınırlıdır ve sahip olduğumuz kelime sayısı da çok azdır. Eski Türkçe adlanan bu lügat sadece Orhun-Yenisey yazıtları ile tespit edilen ve Uygur yazıtları ile devam eden Türkçenin malum en eski yazılı kaynaklarının sözlüğüdür. Yer yüzündeki diller arasında Türkçenin yerine baktığımızda, Ural-Altay dil grubunun Altay koluna bağlı bir dil olduğu ve geçmişinin M.Ö. 4000’li yıllara indiği görülür. Bu tarihten, M.Ö. 5. yüzyıla kadar olan dönem genel olarak Altay veya Proto-Türk devri olarak adlandırılır. Bu dönemde Türkçe ile ilgili az da olsa birtakım dil kalıntılarına rastlanır; ancak bunun yeterli olmaması ve bu dönemden bize yazılı herhangi bir metnin ulaşmaması, bu çağların karanlık dönem olarak adlandırılmasına neden olmuştur. Bu dönemde Türkçenin Çuvaşça ve Yakutça ile henüz ayrılmadığı, hattâ daha eskiye gittiğimizde Moğol, Mançu, Tunguz dilleriyle aynı çatı altında toplandığı varsayılır. Bilindiği gibi daha önce Eski Türkçe döneminin ayrı ayrı metinlerini kapsayan birçok sözlük çalışması yapılmıştır. Ancak bu sözlükler birbirinden bağımsız hazırlanmış, bir kısmı Göktürk dönemi ile Orhun Yazıtlarını, diğer bir kısmı da (İslam öncesi) Uygur dönemi ile bu dönem metinlerini temel almıştır. Eski Türkçe bir bütün olarak düşünüldüğünde, bu sözlüklerin bazı yönlerden yetersiz kaldığı bir gerçektir. Bu çalışmanın genel amacı, daha önce ortaya konulan Eski Türkçe sözlükleri bir araya getirerek Göktürk ve Uygur dönemlerini birlikte ele alan, daha kapsamlı ve tek bir sözlük oluşturmaktır. O bakımdan daha önce meydana getirilen sözlük çalışmaları temel alınarak ortaya yeni bir sözlük konulmuştur.",5

KESIAPAN ANAK MASUK SEKOLAH DASAR,"Dwi Anisa Faqumala, Yuli Kurniawati Sugiyo Pranoto",2020-10-15,Education,"Para orangtua di Indonesia selalu menekankan orientasi kesiapan anak hanya pada aspek membaca, menulis dan berhitung (aspek akademik). Namun sesungguhnya kesiapan anak masuk sekolah dasar tidak hanya membutuhkan aspek kognitif saja namun juga harus mempersiapkan aspek yang lain seperti aspek fisik-motorik, sosial, emosi, moral dan agama. Kesiapan menjadi hal yang sangat penting untuk dimiliki anak, sebab anak yang telah siap untuk pergi ke sekolah akan memberikan keuntungan dan kemajuan dalam perkembangan lebih lanjut. Sementara anak-anak yang tidak memiliki kesiapan mungkin hanya akan frustrasi jika ditempatkan di lingkungan akademik. Melalui kesiapan sekolah anak-anak mendapatkan jalur yang pasti untuk karir akademis jangka panjang. Seiring dengan faktor penentu utama faktor kesiapan sekolah seperti latar belakang keluarga, intervensi yang diberikan kepada anak-anak dan guru, pengalaman pendidikan anak usia dini, konten kurikulum dan pengalaman guru adalah faktor yang mempengaruhi kesiapan sekolah.

Metodologias Ativas,"Ana Paula Sefton, Marcos Evandro Galini",2022-10-26,Education,"No campo educacional, seguimos com muitos desafios em proporcionar uma prática educativa voltada para a experiência significativa dos estudantes. Em diferentes realidades sociais e culturais, bem como em distintos segmentos de ensino, é bem verdade que a Educação segue sendo desvalorizada do ponto de vista socioeconômico e cultural. O peso de antigos paradigmas educacionais, a falta de investimentos e reconhecimento de profissionais, as mudanças tecnológicas, tendem a aumentar os obstáculos. O propósito desta obra, frente a esta realidade, é provocar reflexões e dialogar sobre a ação criativa e ativa das práticas pedagógicas, entendendo os desafios e as sobrecargas da docência e das demandas socioemocionais atuais. Nesta leitura, o diálogo versará pelos seguintes tópicos: - O que são metodologias ativas e qual a correlação destas com a busca de um olhar crítico frente a paradigmas educacionais vigentes em nossa sociedade; - Quais as possibilidades que a visão sistêmica das metodologias ativas nos traz, como a forma individualizada e personalizada do processo de aprendizagem e do ensino adaptativo, inclusive sob a perspectiva de inteligências múltiplas; - Frente a um olhar focado na aprendizagem significativa, quais as contribuições dos pilares da Educação da UNESCO, da BNCC e da Avaliação Formativa; - Quais as competências necessárias do docente para que este possa ativar, provocar e desenvolver junto aos estudantes a melhor e mais significativa experiência de aprendizagem; - Como ampliar e aprimorar a prática por meio de um repositório de metodologias ativas e da relação destas com o ensino híbrido (aprendizagem baseada em problemas, aprendizagem baseada em projetos, estudo de caso, aprendizagem em pares, modelo de rotação – rotação por estações, laboratórios rotacionais, rotação individual, sala de aula invertida); - Quais as contribuições extras para o campo da Educação, no que envolve design thinking, cultura maker, gamificação, STEAM.

The Thriving Adolescent,"Louise L. Hayes, Joseph V. Ciarrochi",2015-11-01,Psychology,"Adolescents face unique pressures and worries. Will they pass high school? Should they go to college? Will they find love? And what ways do they want to act in the world? The uncertainty surrounding the future can be overwhelming. Sadly, and all too often, if things don’t go smoothly, adolescents will begin labeling themselves as losers, unpopular, unattractive, weird, or dumb. And, let’s not forget the ubiquitous ‘not good enough’ story that often begins during these formative years. These labels are often carried forward throughout life. So what can you do, now, to help lighten this lifelong burden? The Thriving Adolescent offers teachers, counselors, and mental health professionals powerful techniques for working with adolescents. Based in proven- effective acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), the skills and tips outlined in this book will help adolescents and teens manage difficult emotions, connect with their values, achieve mindfulness and vitality, and develop positive relationships with friends and family. The evidence-based practices in this book focus on developing a strong sense of self, and will give adolescents the confidence they need to make that difficult transition into adulthood. Whether it’s school, family, or friend related, adolescents experience a profound level of stress, and often they lack the psychological tools to deal with stress in productive ways. The skills we impart to them now will help set the stage for a happy, healthy adulthood. If you work with adolescents or teens, this is a must-have addition to your professional library.",5
Barking Up the Wrong Tree,Eric Barker,2017-05-16,Business & Economics,"Wall Street Journal Bestseller Much of the advice we’ve been told about achievement is logical, earnest…and downright wrong. In Barking Up the Wrong Tree, Eric Barker reveals the extraordinary science behind what actually determines success and most importantly, how anyone can achieve it. You’ll learn: • Why valedictorians rarely become millionaires, and how your biggest weakness might actually be your greatest strength • Whether nice guys finish last and why the best lessons about cooperation come from gang members, pirates, and serial killers • Why trying to increase confidence fails and how Buddhist philosophy holds a superior solution • The secret ingredient to “grit” that Navy SEALs and disaster survivors leverage to keep going • How to find work-life balance using the strategy of Genghis Khan, the errors of Albert Einstein, and a little lesson from Spider-Man By looking at what separates the extremely successful from the rest of us, we learn what we can do to be more like them—and find out in some cases why it’s good that we aren’t. Barking Up the Wrong Tree draws on startling statistics and surprising anecdotes to help you understand what works and what doesn’t so you can stop guessing at success and start living the life you want.",2

Futurism and the Technological Imagination,Günter Berghaus,2009,Art,"This volume, Futurism and the Technological Imagination, results from a conference of the International Society for the Study of European Ideas in Helsinki. It contains a number of re-written conference contributions as well as several specially commissioned essays that address various aspects of the Futurists' relationship to technology both on an ideological level and with regard to their artistic languages. In the early twentieth century, many art movements vied with each other to overhaul the aesthetic and ideological foundations of arts and literature and to make them suitable vehicles of expression in the new Era of the Machine. Some of the most remarkable examples came from the Futurist movement, founded in 1909 by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. By addressing the full spectrum of Futurist attitudes to science and the machine world, this collection of 14 essays offers a multifaceted account of the complex and often contradictory features of the Futurist technological imagination. The volume will appeal to anybody interested in the history of modern culture, art and literature.",5
Infinite Bandwidth,Eugene Gan,2010,Computers,"Franciscan University of Steubenville Professor Eugene Gan authors this first-of-its-kind Catholic roadmap for the digital age: Infinite Bandwidth: Encountering Christ in the Media. He navigates you faithfully through the digital world, encouraging frustrated parents not to throw out cell phones, ban the Internet, chuck computers, or pitch portable media devices. That would be a mistake and believe it or not would be going against more than seven decades of Catholic teaching. From Church documents on social communications, Gan extracts seven principles or ""media keys"" of how to approach and use media. The Church and Gan say that we must enter into the modern day ""Areopagus,"" the social and intellectual hub of ancient Athens where Paul preached to pagans, and use the media tools God has given us to make truth known and serve mankind. Cardinal John Patrick Foley says, ""Frankly, I wish that such a book had existed when I was president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications as a text which I could have recommended. The important thing, however, is that it exists now to provide a text, context, and challenge for those who wish to bring both Christian principles and professional excellence to their work in the media."" Gan offers chapter after chapter of real-life experience of how to assess movies, games, and gadgets for you and your teens. Of how to judge the merits of a film like Saving Private Ryan, and what sets it apart from Nightmare on Elm Street. Can the one be acceptable viewing and the other not? Definitely. And Gan details why. Infinite Bandwidth: Encountering Christ in the Media is way out front of the newest gizmo and will stay there thanks to its timeless principles that can be applied in all digital terrain, now and the future. Parents, educators, and students will put this book down with an entirely different attitude about the relationship between faith and media use.",5

Eating Right in the Renaissance,Ken Albala,2002-02-01,Cooking,"Eating right has been an obsession for longer than we think. Renaissance Europe had its own flourishing tradition of dietary advice. Then, as now, an industry of experts churned out diet books for an eager and concerned public. Providing a cornucopia of information on food and an intriguing account of the differences between the nutritional logic of the past and our own time, this inviting book examines the wide-ranging dietary literature of the Renaissance. Ken Albala ultimately reveals the working of the Renaissance mind from a unique perspective: we come to understand a people through their ideas on food. Eating Right in the Renaissance takes us through an array of historical sources in a narrative that is witty and spiced with fascinating details. Why did early Renaissance writers recommend the herbs parsley, arugula, anise, and mint to fortify sexual prowess? Why was there such a strong outcry against melons and cucumbers, even though people continued to eat them in large quantities? Why was wine considered a necessary nutrient? As he explores these and other questions, Albala explains the history behind Renaissance dietary theories; the connections among food, exercise, and sex; the changing relationship between medicine and cuisine; and much more. Whereas modern nutritionists may promise a slimmer waistline, more stamina, or freedom from disease, Renaissance food writers had entirely different ideas about the value of eating right. As he uncovers these ideas from the past, Ken Albala puts our own dietary obsessions in an entirely new light in this elegantly written and often surprising new chapter on the history of food.",3.5

""The methods here [will] inspire us with their resourcefulness, their promise of goodness, and with the idea that we can eat well year around.""—Deborah Madison Over 100,00 copies sold! Typical books about preserving garden produce nearly always assume that modern ""kitchen gardeners"" will boil or freeze their vegetables and fruits. Yet here is a book that goes back celebrating traditional but little-known French techniques for storing and preserving edibles in ways that maximize flavor and nutrition. Translated into English, and with a new foreword by Deborah Madison, this book deliberately ignores freezing and high-temperature canning in favor of methods that are superior because they are less costly and more energy-efficient. Inside, you’ll learn how to: Preserve without nutrient loss Preserve by drying Preserve with oil, vinegar, salt, and sugar Make sweet-and-sour preserves Preserve with alcohol As Eliot Coleman says in his foreword to the first edition, ""Food preservation techniques can be divided into two categories: the modern scientific methods that remove the life from food, and the natural 'poetic' methods that maintain or enhance the life in food. The poetic techniques produce... foods that have been celebrated for centuries and are considered gourmet delights today.""

Cooked,Michael Pollan,2013-04-23,Social Science,"Michael Pollan, the bestselling author of The Omnivore's Dilemma, Food Rules, How to Change Your Mind, and This is Your Mind on Plants explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen in Cooked. ""Having described what's wrong with American food in his best-selling The Omnivore's Dilemma (2006), New York Times contributor Pollan delivers a more optimistic but equally fascinating account of how to do it right. . . . A delightful chronicle of the education of a cook who steps back frequently to extol the scientific and philosophical basis of this deeply satisfying human activity."" —Kirkus (starred review) Cooked is now a Netflix docuseries based on the book that focuses on the four kinds of ""transformations"" that occur in cooking. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney and starring Michael Pollan, Cooked teases out the links between science, culture and the flavors we love. In Cooked, Pollan discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. Each section of Cooked tracks Pollan’s effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse–trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius “fermentos” (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships. Cooking, above all, connects us. The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.",5

The Wild Wisdom of Weeds,Katrina Blair,2014-10-07,Nature,"The Wild Wisdom of Weeds is the only book on foraging and edible weeds to focus on the thirteen weeds found all over the world, each of which represents a complete food source and extensive medical pharmacy and first-aid kit. More than just a field guide to wild edibles, it is a global plan for human survival. When Katrina Blair was eleven she had a life-changing experience where wild plants spoke to her, beckoning her to become a champion of their cause. Since then she has spent months on end taking walkabouts in the wild, eating nothing but what she forages, and has become a wild-foods advocate, community activist, gardener, and chef, teaching and presenting internationally about foraging and the healthful lifestyle it promotes. Katrina Blair’s philosophy in The Wild Wisdom of Weeds is sobering, realistic, and ultimately optimistic. If we can open our eyes to see the wisdom found in these weeds right under our noses, instead of trying to eradicate an “invasive,” we will achieve true food security. The Wild Wisdom of Weeds is about healing ourselves both in body and in spirit, in an age where technology, commodity agriculture, and processed foods dictate the terms of our intelligence. But if we can become familiar with these thirteen edible survival weeds found all over the world, we will never go hungry, and we will become closer to our own wild human instincts—all the while enjoying the freshest, wildest, and most nutritious food there is. For free! The thirteen plants found growing in every region across the world are: dandelion, mallow, purslane, plantain, thistle, amaranth, dock, mustard, grass, chickweed, clover, lambsquarter, and knotweed.

Wheat Belly,William Davis,2014-06-03,Health & Fitness,"Includes a sneak peek of Undoctored—the new book from Dr. Davis! In this #1 New York Times bestseller, a renowned cardiologist explains how eliminating wheat from our diets can prevent fat storage, shrink unsightly bulges, and reverse myriad health problems. Every day, over 200 million Americans consume food products made of wheat. As a result, over 100 million of them experience some form of adverse health effect, ranging from minor rashes and high blood sugar to the unattractive stomach bulges that preventive cardiologist William Davis calls ""wheat bellies."" According to Davis, that excess fat has nothing to do with gluttony, sloth, or too much butter: It's due to the whole grain wraps we eat for lunch. After witnessing over 2,000 patients regain their health after giving up wheat, Davis reached the disturbing conclusion that wheat is the single largest contributor to the nationwide obesity epidemic—and its elimination is key to dramatic weight loss and optimal health. In Wheat Belly, Davis exposes the harmful effects of what is actually a product of genetic tinkering and agribusiness being sold to the American public as ""wheat""—and provides readers with a user-friendly, step-by-step plan to navigate a new, wheat-free lifestyle. Informed by cutting-edge science and nutrition, along with case studies from men and women who have experienced life-changing transformations in their health after waving goodbye to wheat, Wheat Belly is an illuminating look at what is truly making Americans sick and an action plan to clear our plates of this seemingly benign ingredient.",3

Out of the East,Paul Freedman,2008-03-25,History,"How medieval Europe’s infatuation with expensive, fragrant, exotic spices led to an era of colonial expansion and discovery: “A consummate delight.” —Marion Nestle, James Beard Award–winning author of Unsavory Truth The demand for spices in medieval Europe was extravagant—and was reflected in the pursuit of fashion, the formation of taste, and the growth of luxury trade. It inspired geographical and commercial exploration, as traders pursued such common spices as pepper and cinnamon and rarer aromatic products, including ambergris and musk. Ultimately, the spice quest led to imperial missions that were to change world history. This engaging book explores the demand for spices: Why were they so popular, and why so expensive? Paul Freedman surveys the history, geography, economics, and culinary tastes of the Middle Ages to uncover the surprisingly varied ways that spices were put to use—in elaborate medieval cuisine, in the treatment of disease, for the promotion of well-being, and to perfume important ceremonies of the Church. Spices became symbols of beauty, affluence, taste, and grace, Freedman shows, and their expense and fragrance drove the engines of commerce and conquest at the dawn of the modern era. “A magnificent, very well written, and often entertaining book that is also a major contribution to European economic and social history, and indeed one with a truly global perspective.” —American Historical Review",5

Cheese and Culture,Paul Kindstedt,2012-04-01,Cooking,"Behind every traditional type of cheese there is a fascinating story. By examining the role of the cheesemaker throughout world history and by understanding a few basic principles of cheese science and technology, we can see how different cheeses have been shaped by and tailored to their surrounding environment, as well as defined by their social and cultural context. Cheese and Culture endeavors to advance our appreciation of cheese origins by viewing human history through the eyes of a cheese scientist. There is also a larger story to be told, a grand narrative that binds all cheeses together into a single history that started with the discovery of cheese making and that is still unfolding to this day. This book reconstructs that 9000-year story based on the often fragmentary information that we have available. Cheese and Culture embarks on a journey that begins in the Neolithic Age and winds its way through the ensuing centuries to the present. This tour through cheese history intersects with some of the pivotal periods in human prehistory and ancient, classical, medieval, renaissance, and modern history that have shaped western civilization, for these periods also shaped the lives of cheesemakers and the diverse cheeses that they developed. The book offers a useful lens through which to view our twenty-first century attitudes toward cheese that we have inherited from our past, and our attitudes about the food system more broadly. This refreshingly original book will appeal to anyone who loves history, food, and especially good cheese.",5
Water,"John J. Palmer, Colin Kaminski",2013-09-16,Cooking,"Water is arguably the most critical and least understood of the foundation elements in brewing. For many brewers used to choosing from a wide selection of hops and grain, water seems like an ingredient for which they have little choice but to accept what comes out of their faucet. But brewers in fact have many opportunities to modify their source water or to obtain mineral-free water and build their own brewing water from scratch. Much of the relevant information can be found in texts on physical and inorganic chemistry or water treatment and analysis, but these resources seldom, if ever, speak to brewers. Water: A Comprehensive Guide for Brewers takes the mystery out of water's role in the brewing process. This book is not just about brewing liquor. Whether in a brewery or at home, water is needed for every part of the brewing process: chilling, diluting, cleaning, boiler operation, wastewater treatment, and even physically pushing wort or beer from one place to another. The authors lead the reader from an overview of the water cycle and water sources, to adjusting water for different beer styles and brewery processes, to wastewater treatment. It covers precipitation, groundwater, and surface water, and explains how municipal water is treated to make it safe to drink but not always suitable for brewing. The parameters measured in a water report are explained, along with their impact on the mash and the final beer. Understand ion concentrations, temporary and permanent hardness, and pH. The concept of residual alkalinity is covered in detail and the causes of alkalinity in water are explored, along with techniques to control alkalinity. Ultimately, residual alkalinity is the major effector on mash pH, and this book addresses how to predict and target a specific mash pH—a key skill for any brewer wishing to raise their beer to the next level. But minerals in brewing water also determine specific flavor attributes. Ionic species important to beer are discussed and concepts like the sulfate-to-chloride ratio are explained. Examples illustrate how to tailor your brewing water to suit any style of beer. To complete the subject, the authors focus on brewery operations relating to source water treatment, such as the removal of particulates, dissolved solids, gas and liquid contaminants, organic contaminants, chlorine and chloramine, and dissolved oxygen. This section considers the pros and cons of various technologies, including membrane technologies such as filtration, ion-exchange systems, and reverse osmosis.",5
Health and Quality of Life,Gerhard Aumüller,2002,Medical,"How could one define health and disease? On what presuppositions, and ought we look for such definitions? Does quality of life inherit a subjective or objective evaluation? Are health and quality of life culture dependent concepts? Under the conditions of technologically advanced medicine and the common tendency towards a hedonistic lifestyle such questions come into focus. Hence, one question is of special relevance: which role does health play in our quality of life? The contributions of this interdisciplinary volume aim at the clarification of the various concepts in use. International scholars and scientists outline the framework for a more comprehensive and demanding concept of health and quality of life including philosophical and cultural aspects as well as medical and psychological dimensions.",3
Empowering African Women for Sustainable Development,Ogechi Adeola,2020-12-17,Social Science,"This edited volume assesses the progress that sub-Saharan African countries have made towards gender equality and offers strategies that can be used to empower African women to contribute to the fulfilment of the United Nations’ (UN) 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Recalled to Health,Tim Hennessy,2010,Health & Fitness,"Dr. Tim Hennessy has skillfully drawn on his life experiences to put together this new book he has written. Recalled to Health functions as both a personal memoir of his path to becoming a doctor and a useful medical guide to achieving and keeping good health. Written over a five-year period in between his work as a doctor and his other professional and personal pursuits, Dr. Hennessy says the initial impetus for it came from his bimonthly e-mail health newsletter, H-mail: Medical Education Made Easy. Self-described as conservative with medicine, Hennessy's focus for this book is to promote freedom by inspiring one and all to live healthier lives, in the process becoming less dependent on medications and the flawed healthcare system, and more emboldened to live life to its fullest, unimpeded by the physical constraints of poor health. By providing a medical foundation that will lead to a better understanding of medical topics, the doctor believes that Recalled to Health can empower readers to take charge of their own health. Cholesterol, blood pressure, diet and weight management, exercise, sleeping habits, and the role of nature in health are some of the topics discussed in full here, along with suggestions for optimum actions, behaviors, and treatments. Each of the chapters end with a helpful summary of tips, and the back of the book contains numerous, fully cited references listed by chapters as well as a full index.

The Chelation Controversy,"Gregory Pouls, Maile Pouls",2005,Health & Fitness,"Safely Rid Your Body of Stored Chemicals and Heavy Metals If you live in this modern world of ours, your body is being exposed to oxidizing chemicals and heavy metals such as aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, and lead on a daily basis. When your body starts accumulating toxins faster than it can eliminate them, it begins to store them in your tissues. These stored toxins initiate degenerative processes in your body that can lead to diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and arthritis. Chelating agents--substances that latch on to and carry toxins out of the body--can help you free yourself of this destructive load. In The Chelation Controversy, Drs. Gregory and Maile Pouls discuss the use of chelating agents, including those taken orally and those given intravenously. The authors also familiarize you with some of the controversy surrounding chelation therapy. In addition to a comprehensive guide to the ""big six"" heavy metals and a discussion on the harmful effects of oxidation, the authors cover the most common prescription IV and oral chelating agents. They also provide guidance on what to look for in an oral chelation formula and describe the nutritional substances and antioxidants that can support your detoxification efforts. If your exposure to toxins is higher than average or if you simply want to preserve, maintain, support, and enhance your health, energy, and vitality in this toxic world, The Chelation Controversy provides the information you need to put this therapy to work for you.",4

The Adapted Mind,"Jerome H. Barkow, Leda Cosmides, John Tooby",1995-10-19,Science,"Although researchers have long been aware that the species-typical architecture of the human mind is the product of our evolutionary history, it has only been in the last three decades that advances in such fields as evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, and paleoanthropology have made the fact of our evolution illuminating. Converging findings from a variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface of expressed cultural variability. Second, this collection of cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the adaptive problems regularly faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors--problems such as mate selection, language acquisition, cooperation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently, the traditional view of the mind as a general-purpose computer, tabula rasa, or passive recipient of culture is being replaced by the view that the mind resembles an intricate network of functionally specialized computers, each of which imposes contentful structure on human mental organization and culture. The Adapted Mind explores this new approach--evolutionary psychology--and its implications for a new view of culture.",5
Metaphors We Live By,"George Lakoff, Mark Johnson",2008-12-19,Philosophy,"The now-classic Metaphors We Live By changed our understanding of metaphor and its role in language and the mind. Metaphor, the authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects. Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are ""metaphors we live by""—metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them. In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.",5

Caveman Chemistry,Kevin M. Dunn,2003,Education,"Half a million years ago our ancestors learned to make fire from scratch. They crafted intricate tools from stone and brewed mind-altering elixirs from honey. Their descendants transformed clay into pottery, wool into clothing, and ashes into cleansers. In ceramic crucibles they won metal from rock, the metals lead to colored glazes and glass. Buildings of brick and mortar enshrined books of parchment and paper. Kings and queens demanded ever more colorful clothing and accessories in order to out-class clod-hoppers and call-girls. Kingdoms rose and fell by the power of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal. And the demands of everyday folk for glass and paper and soap stimulated the first round of chemical industrialization. From sulfuric acid to sodium carbonate. From aniline dyes to analgesic drugs. From blasting powder to fertilizers and plastics. In a phrase, From Caveman to Chemist. Your guides on this journey are the four alchemical elements; Fire, Earth, Air and Water. These archetypical characters deliver first-hand accounts of the births of their respective technologies. The spirit of Fire, for example, was born in the first creature to cultivate the flame. This spirit passed from one person to another, from one generation to another, from one millennium to another, arriving at last in the pages of this book. The spirit of Earth taught folks to make tools of stone, the spirit of Air imparted knowledge of units and the spirit of Water began with the invention of spirits. Having traveled the world from age to age, who can say where they will find their next home? Perhaps they will find one in you.",4.5
The Elements of Statistical Learning,"Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman",2013-11-11,Mathematics,"During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for “wide” data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.",4
"Good Habits, Bad Habits",Wendy Wood,2019-10-01,Science,"A landmark book about how we form habits, and what we can do with this knowledge to make positive change We spend a shocking 43 percent of our day doing things without thinking about them. That means that almost half of our actions aren’t conscious choices but the result of our non-conscious mind nudging our body to act along learned behaviors. How we respond to the people around us; the way we conduct ourselves in a meeting; what we buy; when and how we exercise, eat, and drink—a truly remarkable number of things we do every day, regardless of their complexity, operate outside of our awareness. We do them automatically. We do them by habit. And yet, whenever we want to change something about ourselves, we rely on willpower. We keep turning to our conscious selves, hoping that our determination and intention will be enough to effect positive change. And that is why almost all of us fail. But what if you could harness the extraordinary power of your unconscious mind, which already determines so much of what you do, to truly reach your goals? Wendy Wood draws on three decades of original research to explain the fascinating science of how we form habits, and offers the key to unlocking our habitual mind in order to make the changes we seek. A potent mix of neuroscience, case studies, and experiments conducted in her lab, Good Habits, Bad Habits is a comprehensive, accessible, and above all deeply practical book that will change the way you think about almost every aspect of your life. By explaining how our brains are wired to respond to rewards, receive cues from our surroundings, and shut down when faced with too much friction, Wood skillfully dissects habit formation, demonstrating how we can take advantage of this knowledge to form better habits. Her clear and incisive work shows why willpower alone is woefully inadequate when we’re working toward building the life we truly want, and offers real hope for those who want to make positive change.",5
It's ONLY Rocket Science,Lucy Rogers,2008-03-08,Technology & Engineering,"Most amateur astronomers – and many of those with similar interests but who are not currently practising observers – have only a sketchy understanding of space flight. This book provides an introduction to its mechanics. The beauty of this book, written by an engineer who is also an accomplished science writer, is that it covers the subject comprehensively, and yet is almost entirely descriptive and non-mathematical. It deals with all aspects of space flight, from how to leave the Earth (including the design of the rocket, mission planning, navigation and communication), to life in space and the effects of weightlessness. The book also includes sections describing how an amateur can track satellites and understand their orbital parameters.",5

New Scientist: The Origin of (almost) Everything,"New Scientist, Stephen Hawking, Graham Lawton",2016-09-22,Science,"Introduction by Professor Stephen Hawking. When Edwin Hubble looked into his telescope in the 1920s, he was shocked to find that nearly all of the galaxies he could see through it were flying away from one another. If these galaxies had always been travelling, he reasoned, then they must, at some point, have been on top of one another. This discovery transformed the debate about one of the most fundamental questions of human existence - how did the universe begin? Every society has stories about the origin of the cosmos and its inhabitants, but now, with the power to peer into the early universe and deploy the knowledge gleaned from archaeology, geology, evolutionary biology and cosmology, we are closer than ever to understanding where it all came from. In The Origin of (almost) Everything, New Scientist explores the modern origin stories of everything from the Big Bang, meteorites and dark energy, to dinosaurs, civilisation, timekeeping, belly-button fluff and beyond. From how complex life evolved on Earth, to the first written language, to how humans conquered space, The Origin of (almost) Everything offers a unique history of the past, present and future of our universe.",5
Chemical Technology in the Pre-Treatment Processes of Textiles,S.R. Karmakar,1999-11-02,Technology & Engineering,"Textile chemical processing today, particularly the pre-treatment processes require a highly sophisticated technology and engineering to achieve the well known concepts of ""Right first time, Right everytime and Right on time"" processing and production. Chemical pre-treatment may be broadly defined as a procedure mainly concerned with the removal of natural as well as added impurities in fabric to a level necessary for good whiteness and absorbency by utilising minimum time, energy and chemicals as well as water. This book discusses the fundamental aspects of chemistry, chemical technology and machineries involved in the various pre-treatment process of textiles before subsequent dyeing, printing and finishing. With the introduction of newer fibres, specialty chemicals, improved technology and sophisticated machineries developed during the last decade, this book fills a gap in this area of technology. However, its real strength is its clear perception of ample background description, which will enable readers to understand most current journals, thus staying abreast of the latest advances in the field.",3
American Carnage,Tim Alberta,2019-07-16,Political Science,"New York Times Bestseller “Not a conventional Trump-era book. It is less about the daily mayhem in the White House than about the unprecedented capitulation of a political party. This book will endure for helping us understand not what is happening but why it happened…. [An] indispensable work.”—Washington Post Politico Magazine’s chief political correspondent provides a rollicking insider’s look at the making of the modern Republican Party—how a decade of cultural upheaval, populist outrage, and ideological warfare made the GOP vulnerable to a hostile takeover from the unlikeliest of insurgents: Donald J. Trump. As George W. Bush left office with record-low approval ratings and Barack Obama led a Democratic takeover of Washington, Republicans faced a moment of reckoning: they had no vision, no generation of new leaders, and no energy in the party’s base. Yet Obama’s progressive agenda, coupled with the nation’s rapidly changing cultural identity, lit a fire under the right. Republicans regained power in Congress but spent that time fighting among themselves. With these struggles weakening the party’s defenses, and with more and more Americans losing faith in the political class, the stage was set for an outsider to crash the party. When Trump descended a gilded escalator to launch his campaign in the summer of 2015, the candidate had met the moment. Only by viewing Trump as the culmination of a decade-long civil war inside the GOP can we appreciate how he won the White House and consider the fundamental questions at the center of America’s current turmoil. Loaded with explosive original reporting and based on hundreds of exclusive interviews—including with key players such as President Trump, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell—American Carnage takes us behind the scenes of this tumultuous period and establishes Tim Alberta as the premier chronicler of a political era.",5

El origen de las especies,Charles Robert Darwin,2019-03-01,Science,"El origen de las especies —publicado originalmente el 24 de noviembre de 1859,escrito por Charles darwin es considerado uno de los trabajos precursores de la literatura científica y el fundamento de la teoría de la biología evolutiva, más importantes en la historia de la humanidad Este libro introdujo la teoría científica de que las poblaciones evolucionan durante el transcurso de las generaciones mediante un proceso conocido como selección natural. Para el efecto, Darwin presentó las pruebas que reunió en su expedición en el viaje del Beagle en la década de 1830, mediante las cuales propuso que la diversidad de la vida surgió de la descendencia común a través de un patrón ramificado de evolución. Aunque ya se habían propuesto varias ideas evolucionistas para explicar los nuevos descubrimientos de la biología, hubo mayor apoyo a estas ideas entre los anatomistas disidentes y el público en general, pese a las resistencias derivadas de la influencia religiosa en las investigaciones científicas. Las implicaciones políticas y teológicas fueron debatidas intensamente, pero la transmutación no fue aceptada por la corriente científica. El libro fue escrito para lectores no especializados, y suscitó enorme interés a partir de su publicación. Como Darwin era un eminente científico, sus conclusiones fueron tomadas en serio y las pruebas que presentaba generaron un debate científico, filosófico y religioso. En dos décadas hubo un acuerdo científico general de que había ocurrido la evolución, con un patrón ramificado de descendencia común, pero los científicos tardaron en darle a la selección natural la importancia que Darwin creía conveniente.",2
The Anatomy of Violence,Adrian Raine,2013-04-30,Social Science,"With a 4-page full-color insert, and black-and-white illustrations throughout Why do some innocent kids grow up to become cold-blooded serial killers? Is bad biology partly to blame? For more than three decades Adrian Raine has been researching the biological roots of violence and establishing neurocriminology, a new field that applies neuroscience techniques to investigate the causes and cures of crime. In The Anatomy of Violence, Raine dissects the criminal mind with a fascinating, readable, and far-reaching scientific journey into the body of evidence that reveals the brain to be a key culprit in crime causation. Raine documents from genetic research that the seeds of sin are sown early in life, giving rise to abnormal physiological functioning that cultivates crime. Drawing on classical case studies of well-known killers in history—including Richard Speck, Ted Kaczynski, and Henry Lee Lucas—Raine illustrates how impairments to brain areas controlling our ability to experience fear, make good decisions, and feel guilt predispose us to violence. He contends that killers can actually be coldhearted: something as simple as a low resting heart rate can give rise to violence. But arguing that biology is not destiny, he also sketches out provocative new biosocial treatment approaches that can change the brain and prevent violence. Finally, Raine tackles the thorny legal and ethical dilemmas posed by his research, visualizing a futuristic brave new world where our increasing ability to identify violent offenders early in life might shape crime-prevention policies, for good and bad. Will we sacrifice our notions of privacy and civil rights to identify children as potential killers in the hopes of helping both offenders and victims? How should we punish individuals with little to no control over their violent behavior? And should parenting require a license? The Anatomy of Violence offers a revolutionary appraisal of our understanding of criminal offending, while also raising provocative questions that challenge our core human values of free will, responsibility, and punishment.",5

An Immense World,Ed Yong,2022-06-21,Nature,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A “thrilling” (The New York Times), “dazzling” (The Wall Street Journal) tour of the radically different ways that animals perceive the world that will fill you with wonder and forever alter your perspective, by Pulitzer Prize–winning science journalist Ed Yong “One of this year’s finest works of narrative nonfiction.”—Oprah Daily ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Time, People, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Slate, Reader’s Digest, Chicago Public Library, Outside, Publishers Weekly, BookPage ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Oprah Daily, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Economist, Smithsonian Magazine, Prospect (UK), Globe & Mail, Esquire, Mental Floss, Marginalian, She Reads, Kirkus Reviews, Library Journal The Earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. But every kind of animal, including humans, is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of our immense world. In An Immense World, Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. We encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth’s magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and even humans who wield sonar like bats. We discover that a crocodile’s scaly face is as sensitive as a lover’s fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision. We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. We listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries that remain unsolved. Funny, rigorous, and suffused with the joy of discovery, An Immense World takes us on what Marcel Proust called “the only true voyage . . . not to visit strange lands, but to possess other eyes.” WINNER OF THE ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL • FINALIST FOR THE KIRKUS PRIZE • FINALIST FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD • LONGLISTED FOR THE PEN/E.O.

Photonic Crystals,"John D. Joannopoulos, Steven G. Johnson, Joshua N. Winn, Robert D. Meade",2011-10-30,Science,"Since it was first published in 1995, Photonic Crystals has remained the definitive text for both undergraduates and researchers on photonic band-gap materials and their use in controlling the propagation of light. This newly expanded and revised edition covers the latest developments in the field, providing the most up-to-date, concise, and comprehensive book available on these novel materials and their applications. Starting from Maxwell's equations and Fourier analysis, the authors develop the theoretical tools of photonics using principles of linear algebra and symmetry, emphasizing analogies with traditional solid-state physics and quantum theory. They then investigate the unique phenomena that take place within photonic crystals at defect sites and surfaces, from one to three dimensions. This new edition includes entirely new chapters describing important hybrid structures that use band gaps or periodicity only in some directions: periodic waveguides, photonic-crystal slabs, and photonic-crystal fibers. The authors demonstrate how the capabilities of photonic crystals to localize light can be put to work in devices such as filters and splitters. A new appendix provides an overview of computational methods for electromagnetism. Existing chapters have been considerably updated and expanded to include many new three-dimensional photonic crystals, an extensive tutorial on device design using temporal coupled-mode theory, discussions of diffraction and refraction at crystal interfaces, and more. Richly illustrated and accessibly written, Photonic Crystals is an indispensable resource for students and researchers. Extensively revised and expanded Features improved graphics throughout Includes new chapters on photonic-crystal fibers and combined index-and band-gap-guiding Provides an introduction to coupled-mode theory as a powerful tool for device design Covers many new topics, including omnidirectional reflection, anomalous refraction and diffraction, computational photonics, and much more.",4.5

The Heart of Islam,Seyyed Hossein Nasr,2009-03-17,Religion,"As the specter of religious extremism has become a fact of life today, the temptation is great to allow the evil actions and perspectives of a minority to represent an entire tradition. In the case of Islam, there has been much recent confusion in the Western world centered on distorted portrayals of its core values. Born of ignorance, such confusion feeds the very problem at hand. In The Heart of Islam one of the great intellectual figures in Islamic history offers a timely presentation of the core spiritual and social values of Islam: peace, compassion, social justice, and respect for the other. Seizing this unique moment in history to reflect on the essence of his tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr seeks to ""open a spiritual and intellectual space for mutual understanding."" Exploring Islamic values in scripture, traditional sources, and history, he also shows their clear counterparts in the Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing the common ground of the Abrahamic faiths. Nasr challenges members of the world's civilizations to stop demonizing others while identifying themselves with pure goodness and to turn instead to a deeper understanding of those shared values that can solve the acute problems facing humanity today. ""Muslims must ask themselves what went wrong within their own societies,"" he writes, ""but the West must also pose the same question about itself . . . whether we are Muslims, Jews, Christians, or even secularists, whether we live in the Islamic world or in the West, we are in need of meaning in our lives, of ethical norms to guide our actions, of a vision that would allow us to live at peace with each other and with the rest of God's creation."" Such help, he believes, lies at the heart of every religion and can lead the followers of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well as other religious and spiritual traditions to a new future of mutual respect and common global purpose. The Heart of Islam is a landmark presentation of enduring value that offers hope to humanity, and a compelling portrait of the beauty and appeal of the faith of 1.2 billion people.",3.5
Wildwood,Roger Deakin,2009-01-06,Nature,"Here, published for the first time in the United States, is the last book by Roger Deakin, famed British nature writer and icon of the environmentalist movement. In Deakin's glorious meditation on wood, the ""fifth element"" -- as it exists in nature, in our culture, and in our souls -- the reader accompanies Deakin through the woods of Britain, Europe, Kazakhstan, and Australia in search of what lies behind man's profound and enduring connection with trees. Deakin lives in forest shacks, goes ""coppicing"" in Suffolk, swims beneath the walnut trees of the Haut-Languedoc, and hunts bushplums with Aboriginal women in the outback. Along the way, he ferrets out the mysteries of woods, detailing the life stories of the timber beams composing his Elizabethan house and searching for the origin of the apple. As the world's forests are whittled away, Deakin's sparkling prose evokes woodlands anarchic with life, rendering each tree as an individual, living being. At once a traveler's tale and a splendid work of natural history, Wildwood reveals, amid the world's marvelous diversity, that which is universal in human experience.",5

Buying Disney's World,Aaron H. Goldberg,2021-02-22,Travel,"In November of 1965, after numerous months of speculation surrounding a mystery industry that had been purchasing large amounts of land in central Florida, Walt Disney finally put an end to the rumors. He announced to the public his grandiose plans for the thousands of acres he had secretly purchased. For the eighteen months prior to the announcement, Walt entrusted a small group of men to covertly make these purchases. Next, they were tasked with drafting a legislative act to submit to the state of Florida that would allow Disney to wield nearly absolute legal control over the property under a quasi-government municipality. Staying true to its storytelling roots, Disney wove a tale of mystery centered around a high-ranking CIA operative, who was rumored to have been, just a few short years before, the paymaster behind the Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba. This savvy and well-connected CIA agent became the de facto leader for the group of Disney executives and attorneys who orchestrated and executed a nearly perfect plan to keep Disney’s identity a secret from the public by utilizing aliases, shell corporations, and meandering travel itineraries, all in an effort to protect the company’s identity during the land acquisition process. As told through the personal notes and files from the key figures involved in the project, Buying Disney’s World details the story of how Walt Disney World came to be, like you’ve never heard before. From conception to construction and everything in between—including how a parcel of land within Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort was acquired during a high-stakes poker game—explore how the company most famous for creating Mickey Mouse acquired central Florida’s swamps, orange groves, and cow pastures to build a Disney fiefdom and a Magic Kingdom.",5
Lake Monster Mysteries,"Benjamin Radford, Joe Nickell",2006-05-05,"Body, Mind & Spirit","Winner of the 2007 Gray's Lake FCBC Book Award For centuries, eyewitnesses around the world—from America to Africa, Argentina to Scotland—have reported sightings of dark, mysterious creatures in area lakes that surface briefly, only to quickly disappear. While the most famous lake monsters of Loch Ness and Lake Champlain have gained international notoriety, hundreds of lakes around the world are said to shelter these shadowy creatures. Lake Monster Mysteries is the first book to examine these widespread mysteries from a scientific perspective. By using exhaustive research and results from firsthand investigations to help separate truth from myth, the authors foster our understanding of what really lurks in the cold, murky depths. Benjamin Radford and Joe Nickell are considered to be among the top lake monster authorities in the world. Here they share unique insights into many of the world's best-known lake monsters. They interview witnesses and local experts and discuss the different types of lake monster sightings, delve into possible explanations for those sightings, and examine hoaxes, evidence claims, and legends surrounding the monsters. The authors have also conducted groundbreaking fieldwork and experiments at the lakes and have examined recent photographic and sonar evidence. Incorporating newly-revealed information and up-to-date developments in the cases they present, professional monster hunters Radford and Nickell plunge into both the cultural histories of these creatures and the scientific inquiries that may hold the key to these mysteries.",3
The Great Mughals and their India,Dirk Collier,2016-03-01,History,"A definitive, comprehensive and engrossing chronicle of one of the greatest dynasties of the world – the Mughal – from its founder Babur to Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last of the clan. The magnificent Mughal legacy – the world-famous Taj Mahal being the most prominent among countless other examples – is an inexhaustible source of inspiration to historians, writers, moviemakers, artists and ordinary mortals alike. Mughal history abounds with all the ingredients of classical drama: ambition and frustration, hope and despair, grandeur and decline, love and hate, and loyalty and betrayal. In other words: it is great to read and offers ample food for thought on the human condition. Much more importantly, Mughal history deserves to be widely read and reflected upon, because of its lasting cultural and socio-political relevance to today’s world in general and the Indian subcontinent in particular. The Mughals have left us with a legacy that cannot be erased. With regard to the eventful reigns of Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb and their successors, crucial questions arise: Where did they succeed? Where did they fail? And more importantly, what should we learn from their triumphs and failures? The author believes that history books should be accurate, informative and entertaining. In The Great Mughals and Their India, he has kept these objectives in mind in an attempt to narrate Mughal history from their perspective. At the same time, he does not shy away from dealing with controversial issues. Here is a fascinating and riveting saga that brings alive a spectacular bygone era – authentically and convincingly.",1
The Last Wild Men of Borneo,Carl Hoffman,2018-03-06,History,"A 2019 EDGAR AWARDS NOMINEE (BEST FACT CRIME) • A BANFF MOUNTAIN BOOK AWARDS FINALIST Two modern adventurers sought a treasure possessed by the legendary “Wild Men of Borneo.” One found riches. The other vanished forever into an endless jungle. Had he shed civilization—or lost his mind? Global headlines suspected murder. Lured by these mysteries, New York Times bestselling author Carl Hoffman journeyed to find the truth, discovering that nothing is as it seems in the world’s last Eden, where the lines between sinner and saint blur into one. In 1984, Swiss traveler Bruno Manser joined an expedition to the Mulu caves on Borneo, the planet’s third largest island. There he slipped into the forest interior to make contact with the Penan, an indigenous tribe of peace-loving nomads living among the Dayak people, the fabled “Headhunters of Borneo.” Bruno lived for years with the Penan, gaining acceptance as a member of the tribe. However, when commercial logging began devouring the Penan’s homeland, Bruno led the tribe against these outside forces, earning him status as an enemy of the state, but also worldwide fame as an environmental hero. He escaped captivity under gunfire twice, but the strain took a psychological toll. Then, in 2000, Bruno disappeared without a trace. Had he become a madman, a hermit, or a martyr? American Michael Palmieri is, in many ways, Bruno’s opposite. Evading the Vietnam War, the Californian wandered the world, finally settling in Bali in the 1970s. From there, he staged expeditions into the Bornean jungle to acquire astonishing art and artifacts from the Dayaks. He would become one of the world’s most successful tribal-art field collectors, supplying sacred works to prestigious museums and wealthy private collectors. And yet suspicion shadowed this self-styled buccaneer who made his living extracting the treasure of the Dayak: Was he preserving or exploiting native culture? As Carl Hoffman unravels the deepening riddle of Bruno’s disappearance and seeks answers to the questions surrounding both men, it becomes clear saint and sinner are not so easily defined and Michael and Bruno are, in a sense, two parts of one whole: each spent his life in pursuit of the sacred fire of indigenous people. The Last Wild Men of Borneo is the product of Hoffman’s extensive travels to the region, guided by Penan through jungle paths traveled by Bruno and by Palmieri himself up rivers to remote villages. Hoffman also draws on exclusive interviews with Manser’s family and colleagues, and rare access to his letters and journals. Here is a peerless adventure propelled by the entwined lives of two singular, enigmatic men whose stories reveal both the grandeur and the precarious fate of the wildest place on earth.",3

To Shake the Sleeping Self,Jedidiah Jenkins,2018-10-02,Biography & Autobiography,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “With winning candor, Jedidiah Jenkins takes us with him as he bicycles across two continents and delves deeply into his own beautiful heart.”—Cheryl Strayed, author of Wild and Tiny Beautiful Things On the eve of turning thirty, terrified of being funneled into a life he didn’t choose, Jedidiah Jenkins quit his dream job and spent sixteen months cycling from Oregon to Patagonia. He chronicled the trip on Instagram, where his photos and reflections drew hundreds of thousands of followers, all gathered around the question: What makes a life worth living?

Un relato a caballo entre la historia y la literatura de viajes que recupera las expediciones realizadas por Miguel Gutiérrez-Garitano en la búsqueda del reino inca perdido de Vilcabamba. Un viaje emocionante entre el esplendor, el declive y la zozobra, que nos recuerda el drama de un mundo que fue arrasado pero que no terminó de desaparecer tras la muerte de Tupac Amaru, el último guerrero inca que se rebeló contra las huestes española que habían llegado a al continente americano un siglo atrás. En junio de 1572 los conquistadores españoles, al mando del general Hurtado de Arbieto, entraron en la ciudad de Vilcabamba, capital del reino del mismo nombre donde los últimos incas habían resistido durante tres décadas el intento colonizador español.

Hirohito And The Making Of Modern Japan,Herbert P. Bix,2009-10-13,Biography & Autobiography,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize In this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority. Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past. Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.",4
علم المتاحف.. نشأته، فروعه وآثره,د. محمد جمال راشد,2020,Art,"عُرف المجتمع المصري عبر تاريخه الطويل بطبيعته الإجتماعية الودودة وحس الفكاهة، فضلا عن الإلتفاف والمشاركة المجتمعية في الفرح وفي الأحزان والأزمات علي حدا سواء. بل ومن سماته وطرائفه كذلك حس الفضول، فتخيل إذا ما جري حادثاً في الطريق، أو ربما حريق أو مشكلة إذ تجد إلتفاف الناس بسرعة البرق حول الحدث لمعرفة ما يحدث، ومنهم من قد يتأخر علي عمله لمد يد المعاونة، أو لمجرد الحرص علي معرفة ما يحدث، ثم لا يلبث ان يقدم كل واحد تصوره الشخصي للحادث أو الموقف وروشتة للعلاج أو الخروج من الأزمة وتجنب تكرارها. وبعيدا عن كون نظرة البعض لهذه السمات بإعتبارها من الصفات المحمودة أو غير المحمودة لدي المجتمع والفرد، إلا أن الشاهد في الأمر هنا مثل هذه الصفات تمثل نواة وقاعدة للبناء عليها إجتماعيا في مجابهة مشاكل المجتمع ومناقشتها، والوقوف علي الأمراض الإجتماعية وتتبع جذورها وعلاجها - إذا ما توافرت المؤسسات المعنية بدراسة السلوك الإجتماعي للفرد والجماعة داخل المجتمع. وتهيئة المناخ المناسب لعلاج السلوكيات السلبية وتدعيم وتنمية السلوك السوي أو الصحي والسليم. ومن بين المؤسسات المعنية بذلك المؤسسات التربوية والثقافية، والتي يأتي في مقدمتها مؤسسة المتحف. وبلاشك أن مثل هذه الخصائص الإجتماعية للمجتمع المصري إن دلت علي شيء فإنما تدل إلي مدي إمكانية نجاح المُتحف كمؤسسة إجتماعية داخل المجتمع. لما لها من دور في نقل نبض المجتمع وصوته، إلا أن ذلك فيما يبدو لم يتحقق في الواقع كما ينبغي بعد. والشاهد في الحقيقة ليس عزوف المجتمع عن المشاركة بقدر ما هو عدم نجاحنا كمتحفيون في الوصول للمجتمع ولمس إحتياجاته وتوقعاته بالصورة اللازمة. أي أنه أمامنا الكثير من العمل لتطوير متاحفنا ورفع كفاءة المتحفيين العاملين بها، والخدمات التي تقدمها للمجتمع من أجل تحقيق الوصول والتواصل الإيجابي مع المجتمع المصري.  وعلي صعيد المتاحف المصرية، تشهد المتاحف في مصر حراك ونهضة غير مسبوقة منذ نشأتها قبل قرابة القرنين من الزمن. ولعل أهم ما يميز هذا الحراك وتلك النهضة التي تشهدها متاحفنا في السنوات العشر الأخيرة تحديدا، هو أنها تأتي في صورة تغيير جوهري في دور المتحف تجاه المجتمع، وطريقة تفاعل المتاحف مع المجتمع المحيط، فضلا عن تزايد ملحوظ في عدد المتحفيين الذين درسوا أو تدربوا في المتاحف الكبري والمؤسسات المعنية بالمتاحف حول العالم. فكان التغيير، والذي لم يكن أبدا من غرائب الصدف أن يتزامن مع ثورة يناير 2011. وإنما، هو صورة من صور الثورة الحقيقية والتغيير القادم علي يد شباب المتحفيين المصريين، الذين اكتسبوا من الخبرات والمعرفة، ما دفعهم لمحاولة التغيير وتطوير المتاحف المصرية لتكن صورة تعكس المجتمع، وتتفاعل مع مشاكله وإحتياجاته. فلم يعد من المقبول أن تظل متاحفنا بمثابة أبنية محصنة لحفظ وتأمين الأثار وعرضها لجذب السائحين، بإعتبارها مصدر من مصادر الدخل القومي - كما رأتها الحكومات المتتالية علي مدار عقود-، وإنما هي أداة لتنمية المجتمع وتطويره، بجانب دورها الهام في تكوين الشخصية المصرية. هذا الحراك النابع من السواعد الشابة في متاحفنا، والذي لم يلقي التأييد الكافي من قبل مؤسسات الدولة المعنية - في عقود سابقة، أتي بثمارة في إحداث نقله محسوسة في دور المتحف داخل المجتمع، وفي التزايد الملحوظ في عداد المصريين المترددين علي المتاحف اليوم، والتي شملت أيضا تزايد في المشاركة الفعالة من المجتمع في الأنشطة المتحفية التطوعية والثقافية والترفهية. لا يزال الطريق طويلا أمام متاحفنا، وإن كان أول الغيث قطرة. وفي الوقت التي بلغت فيه الدراسات المتحفية ذروتها في أوروبا وأمريكا وبعض الدول الأسيوية مثل اليابان والصين. لا تزال هذه البرامج تحبو أولي خطواتها في مصر. وذلك علي الرغم من كونها أولي دول العالم القديم في إنشاء المتاحف، وفي العصر الحديث كانت كذلك من البلاد الرائدة في إنشاء المتاحف والتي يعود أقدمها في مصر إلي 1836. فضلاً عن كون نشأت التربية المتحفية كأحد أهم فروع علم المتاحف، ربما ترجع نشأتها للنوابغ المصرية علي يد أحمد كمال باشا، في العقدين الإخيرين من القرن التاسع عشر، والذي نهج هذا المنهج عندما ضُيق عليه الخناق، ولم يستطع العمل كأمين مٌتحف بالمتحف المصري في بداية حياته العملية. وعلي الصعيد الأدبي للدراسات المتحفية، فإن المكتبة المصرية تفتقر لمؤلفات متخصصة. إذا أن عدد المؤلفات والكتب التي تطرقت للمتاحف باللغة العربية يمكن حصره علي أصابع اليدين، فضلا عن أن مجمل هذه المؤلفات تستعرض تاريخ ونشأة المتاحف وأهم مقتنياتها بشكل خاص. ويكاد لا يوجد مؤلف واحد في المكتبة المصرية يتناول علم المتاحف كعلم، منهجيته، فروعه وتخصصاته. وهذا ليس تقليل من جهود ما سبق بقدر ما هو توضيح لإهتمامات كتابات كل مرحلة، فقد ركزت كتابات الأجيال السابقة حول تاريخ المتاحف والمتاحف المصرية ومجموعاتها لتوثق لجانب هام وتغطي مرحلة أساسية، بينما وجب أن تتمحور كتابات المرحلة المقبلة علي علم المتاحف، فروعه ومناهج إدارته، تماشيا مع التطور السريع للمتاحف عالميا، وعربيا ومحليا، وكذلك إنعكاسا لمتطلبات البرامج المستحدثة للدراسات المتحفية بالجامعات المصرية. ولعل البادرة الطيبة التي أقدمت عليها مكتبة الإسكندرية بالتعاون مع اللجنة الوطنية المصرية للمتاحف علي إصدار سلسلة ""كراسات متحفية""، والتي صدر منها بعض الكراسات علي مدار الأشهر الماضية تمثل بداية طيبة لهذا النهج الجديد. وقد كان حٌلم وضع هذا المؤلف يراودني خلال السنوات الخمس الماضية، لما لمسته من افتقار للمكتبة العربية لمثل هذا العمل، وكذلك حاجة وإلحاح العديد من شباب الدارسين، والعاملين والمتدربين في مجال المتاحف في مصر، والذين شرفت بالعمل وتدريب الكثير منهم في برامج التدريب المتحفي التي شرفت بتقديمها من خلال وزارة الآثار، فضلا عن التدريس في برامج ماجستير التراث والمتاحف في الجامعة الفرنسية بالقاهرة، وبرنامج الدراسات المتحفية بجمعية إستكشاف مصر البريطانية والمعهد البريطاني بالقاهرة. وأخيرا، تشرفي بالمشاركة في إنشاء قسما جديدا لإدارة المتاحف، بكلية الآثار جامعة دمياط؛ والذي يعد أول قسم لـ إدارة المتاحف في مصر. راجيا الله التوفيق في تخريج دفعات من المتخصصين في هذا المجال الهام. والمؤلف، الذي بين يدي القاريء اليوم، يأتي علي نهج ""علم المتاحف الجديد"". وفيه يتلمس المؤلف الخطوط العريضة لعلم المتاحف، مع محاولة تقديم قراءة صحيحة للعلم، منهجيته، فروعه وخطوطه العامة، مع التأكيد علي التعامل مع علم المتاحف كعلم مستقل، ليس كما يراه البعض كفرع من فروع علم الآثار، وليس بالصورة المقتضبة له بالممارسات التطبيقية للعمل المتحفي.  وعليه فقد قسم الكتاب لتمهيد وثمانية فصول: قدم التمهيد لنشأة علم المتاحف، وعلم المتاحف الجديد، والآراء المختلفة حول تعريف العلم وفصله عن الممارسات التطبيقية للعمل المتحفي. وجاء الفصل الأول، ليتناول نشأة المتاحف في العالم القديم، والمتاحف الحديثة، وتأصيل فكرة الإقتناء والحفظ والعرض. والفصل الثاني، يستعرض التعريفات المختلفة للمتحف، وتأصيل كلمة مُتحف واشتقاقها في اللغة العربية واللغات الأوروبية. وكذلك تطور تعريف المتحف ليكون متماشي مع تطور دوره الفعلي، الوظائف والأدوار الرئيسية التي يقوم بها المتحف والتي حددها تعريفه. والفصل الثالث، ناقش الأهداف المرجوه من إقامة المتاحف، ودور المُتحف تجاه المجتمع وتنميته علي المحاور المختلفة وخلق بيئة إجتماعية صحية، وكذلك القيم التي يقدمها المتحف للمجتمع. وفي الفصل الرابع، يناقش المؤلف الأنواع المختلفة للمتاحف والمجموعات المتحفية، والقواعد المستخدمة في تصنيف المتاحف، مع إعطاء تعريف مبسط وأمثلة للأنواع المختلفة للمتاحف. وينتقل الكتاب في الفصلين التالين للحديث عن بعض المتاحف العالمية موزعة وفق أنواع المتاحف الفصل الخامس، والمتاحف المصرية نشأتها، تطورها، ومراحلها المختلفة، مع التقديم لأقدم وأهم المتاحف المصرية، ملحقا بحصر لجميع المتاحف المصرية الفصل السادس. ثم الفصل السابع، ويستعرض حركة المتاحف في الوطن العربي، أهم المتاحف العربية؛ مع التركيز علي النهضة والنشاط الملحوظ للمتاحف ودوره في بلاد الخليج العربي. ويأتي الفصل الثامن ليناقش موضوع رئيسي وهام، ألا وهو الفروع المختلفة لعلم المتاحف، واختصاص كل فرع من هذه الفروع، أهميته وتطوره. فضلا عن العلوم المساعدة أو العلوم ذات الصلة بعلم المتاحف، وطبيعة العلاقة بينها وبين علم المتاحف. وأخيرا، الفصل التاسع، وهو يستعرض المؤسسات الدولية المعنية بالمتاحف مثل المجلس الدولي للمتاحف، ومهمة هذه المؤسسات، ودورها تجاه المجتمع الدولي للمتاحف، وكيفية الإستفادة منها والتواصل مع أنشطتها المختلفة. وإذ لم يكن لمؤلف واحد أن يُغطي كل جوانب علم المتاحف، فقد روعي في هذا العمل أن يقدم لأهم الموضوعات الحساسة في علم المتاحف، والتي تمكن القاريء والباحث علي الوقوف علي أرض صلبة وتحديد فهم جيد لعلم المتاحف والفروع والإختصاصات الفرعية. هذا ويبقي الأمل في أن يكون هذا الكتاب هو نواة لسلسلة من المؤلفات التي تغطي الفروع المختلفة لعلم المتاحف تصدر تباعا في السنوات القادمة تحت عنوان موسوعة إدارة المتاحف. يأتي في مقدمتها مؤلف بعنوان ""العرض المتحفي""، وأخر بعنوان ""نُظم الإدارة الحديثة للمؤسسات المتحفية""، والمتوقع اصدارهما علي التوالي خلال (2019، 2020).",3

Masterpieces of Nigerian Art,Ekpo Eyo,2014-07-21,Art,"The Federal Republic of Nigeria maintains a rich artistic legacy that is more than two thousand years old. As such, it provides some interesting counterpoints to Western art history. Nigeria's ancient Nok art, for example, predated the golden age of Greece, and the exquisite bronzes of lgbo Ukwu (9th-10th C), Ife (12th-15th C), and Benin (15th-19th C) compare favorably to European traditions. Furthermore, the art of Benin thrived under the patronage of a single, unbroken dynasty during a time when many European governments rose and fell.Yet, for many reasons, the Western world would not recognize this artistic heritage until modern times. In this volume, Ekpo Eyo explains the prirnitivist viewpoint that once dominated the Western perception of African art and recalls the efforts of certain more open-minded individuals from Nigeria's colonial past who, in their efforts to collect, preserve, and present important sculptures and other artworks, were instrumental in founding the country's first museums. Their successor, today's National Commission for Museums and Monuments, has collected many additional works from their original settings, placing them in the limelight of the world through publications and museum exhibitions, to which the author has contributed much throughout his career. Eyo therefore discusses Nigerian art in the broader context of the world's art history, arguing that the art of Nigeria is fundamentally a testament to universal human creativity. From Shrines to Showcases: Masterpieces of Nigerian Art includes examples selected from all major regions of the country, spanning the distant past to the modern age, which are to be considered amongst the greatest artistic achievements of humanity.",4

Curationism,David Balzer,2014-09-22,Social Science,"""Now that we ‘curate’ even lunch, what happens to the role of the connoisseur in contemporary culture? ‘Curate’ is now a buzzword applied to everything from music festivals to artisanal cheese. Inside the art world, the curator reigns supreme, acting as the face of high-profile group shows and biennials in a way that can eclipse and assimilate the contributions of individual artists. At the same time, curatorial studies programs continue to grow in popularity, and businesses are increasingly adopting curation as a means of adding value to content and courting demographics. Everyone, it seems, is a now a curator. But what is a curator, exactly? And what does the explosive popularity of curating say about our culture’s relationship with taste, labour and the avant-garde? In this incisive and original study, critic David Balzer travels through art history and around the globe to explore the cult of curation – where it began, how it came to dominate museums and galleries, and how it was co-opted at the turn of the millennium as the dominant mode of organizing and giving value to content. At the centre of the book is a paradox: curation is institutionalized and expertise-driven like never before, yet the first independent curators were not formally trained, and any act of choosing has become ‘curating.’ Is the professional curator an oxymoron? Has curation reached a sort of endgame, where its widespread fetishization has led to its own demise? David Balzer has contributed to publications including the Believer, Modern Painters, Artforum.com, and The Globe and Mail, and is the author of Contrivances, a short-fiction collection. He is currently Associate Editor at Canadian Art magazine. Balzer was born in Winnipeg and currently resides in Toronto, where he makes a living as a critic, editor and teacher.",5
The Lost Painting,Jonathan Harr,2005-10-25,Art,"Told with consummate skill by the writer of the bestselling, award-winning A Civil Action, The Lost Painting is a remarkable synthesis of history and detective story. An Italian village on a hilltop near the Adriatic coast, a decaying palazzo facing the sea, and in the basement, cobwebbed and dusty, lit by a single bulb, an archive unknown to scholars. Here, a young graduate student from Rome, Francesca Cappelletti, makes a discovery that inspires a search for a work of art of incalculable value, a painting lost for almost two centuries. The artist was Caravaggio, a master of the Italian Baroque. He was a genius, a revolutionary painter, and a man beset by personal demons. Four hundred years ago, he drank and brawled in the taverns and streets of Rome, moving from one rooming house to another, constantly in and out of jail, all the while painting works of transcendent emotional and visual power. He rose from obscurity to fame and wealth, but success didn’t alter his violent temperament. His rage finally led him to commit murder, forcing him to flee Rome a hunted man. He died young, alone, and under strange circumstances. Caravaggio scholars estimate that between sixty and eighty of his works are in existence today. Many others–no one knows the precise number–have been lost to time. Somewhere, surely, a masterpiece lies forgotten in a storeroom, or in a small parish church, or hanging above a fireplace, mistaken for a mere copy. Prizewinning author Jonathan Harr embarks on an spellbinding journey to discover the long-lost painting known as The Taking of Christ–its mysterious fate and the circumstances of its disappearance have captivated Caravaggio devotees for years. After Francesca Cappelletti stumbles across a clue in that dusty archive, she tracks the painting across a continent and hundreds of years of history. But it is not until she meets Sergio Benedetti, an art restorer working in Ireland, that she finally manages to assemble all the pieces of the puzzle. Praise for The Lost Painting “Jonathan Harr has gone to the trouble of writing what will probably be a bestseller . . . rich and wonderful. . . . In truth, the book reads better than a thriller. . . . If you're a sucker for Rome, and for dusk . . . [you'll] enjoy Harr's more clearly reported details about life in the city.”—The New York Times Book Review “Jonathan Harr has taken the story of the lost painting, and woven from it a deeply moving narrative about history, art and taste—and about the greed, envy, covetousness and professional jealousy of people who fall prey to obsession. It is as perfect a work of narrative nonfiction as you could ever hope to read.”—The Economist",5

The Last Wild Men of Borneo,Carl Hoffman,2018-03-06,History,"A 2019 EDGAR AWARDS NOMINEE (BEST FACT CRIME) • A BANFF MOUNTAIN BOOK AWARDS FINALIST Two modern adventurers sought a treasure possessed by the legendary “Wild Men of Borneo.” One found riches. The other vanished forever into an endless jungle. Had he shed civilization—or lost his mind? Global headlines suspected murder. Lured by these mysteries, New York Times bestselling author Carl Hoffman journeyed to find the truth, discovering that nothing is as it seems in the world’s last Eden, where the lines between sinner and saint blur into one. In 1984, Swiss traveler Bruno Manser joined an expedition to the Mulu caves on Borneo, the planet’s third largest island. There he slipped into the forest interior to make contact with the Penan, an indigenous tribe of peace-loving nomads living among the Dayak people, the fabled “Headhunters of Borneo.” Bruno lived for years with the Penan, gaining acceptance as a member of the tribe. However, when commercial logging began devouring the Penan’s homeland, Bruno led the tribe against these outside forces, earning him status as an enemy of the state, but also worldwide fame as an environmental hero. He escaped captivity under gunfire twice, but the strain took a psychological toll. Then, in 2000, Bruno disappeared without a trace. Had he become a madman, a hermit, or a martyr? American Michael Palmieri is, in many ways, Bruno’s opposite. Evading the Vietnam War, the Californian wandered the world, finally settling in Bali in the 1970s. From there, he staged expeditions into the Bornean jungle to acquire astonishing art and artifacts from the Dayaks. He would become one of the world’s most successful tribal-art field collectors, supplying sacred works to prestigious museums and wealthy private collectors. And yet suspicion shadowed this self-styled buccaneer who made his living extracting the treasure of the Dayak: Was he preserving or exploiting native culture? As Carl Hoffman unravels the deepening riddle of Bruno’s disappearance and seeks answers to the questions surrounding both men, it becomes clear saint and sinner are not so easily defined and Michael and Bruno are, in a sense, two parts of one whole: each spent his life in pursuit of the sacred fire of indigenous people. The Last Wild Men of Borneo is the product of Hoffman’s extensive travels to the region, guided by Penan through jungle paths traveled by Bruno and by Palmieri himself up rivers to remote villages. Hoffman also draws on exclusive interviews with Manser’s family and colleagues, and rare access to his letters and journals. Here is a peerless adventure propelled by the entwined lives of two singular, enigmatic men whose stories reveal both the grandeur and the precarious fate of the wildest place on earth.",3
Cézanne in the Studio,Carol Armstrong,2004-11-01,Art,"In the last years of his life Paul Cézanne produced a stunning series of watercolors, many of them sill lifes. Still Life with Blue Pot is one of these late masterpieces that is now in the collection of the Getty Museum. In Cézanne in the Study: Still Life in Watercolors, Carol Armstrong places this great painting within the context of Cezanne’s artistic and psychological development and of the history of the genre of still life in France. Still life—like the medium of watercolor—was traditionally considered to be “low” in the hierarchy of French academic paintings. Cézanne chose to ignore this hierarchy, creating monumental still-life watercolors that contained echoes of grand landscapes and even historical paintings in the manner of Poussin—the “highest” of classical art forms. In so doing he changed his still lifes with new meanings, both in terms of his own notoriously difficult personality and in the way he used the genre to explore the very process of looking at, and creating, art. Carol Armstrong’s study is a fascinating exploration of the brilliant watercolor paintings that brought Cézanne’s career to a complex, and triumphant, conclusion, The book includes new photographic studies of the Getty’s painting that allow the reader to encounter this great watercolor as never before, in all of its richness and detail.",5
Japanese Visual Culture,Mark W. MacWilliams,2008-01-29,Art,"Born of Japan's cultural encounter with Western entertainment media, manga (comic books or graphic novels) and anime (animated films) are two of the most universally recognized forms of contemporary mass culture. Because they tell stories through visual imagery, they vault over language barriers. Well suited to electronic transmission and distributed by Japan's globalized culture industry, they have become a powerful force in both the mediascape and the marketplace. This volume brings together an international group of scholars from many specialties to probe the richness and subtleties of these deceptively simple cultural forms. The contributors explore the historical, cultural, sociological, and religious dimensions of manga and anime, and examine specific sub-genres, artists, and stylistics. The book also addresses such topics as spirituality, the use of visual culture by Japanese new religious movements, Japanese Goth, nostalgia and Japanese pop, comics for girls, and more. With illustrations throughout, it is a rich source for all scholars and fans of manga and anime as well as students of contemporary mass culture or Japanese culture and civilization.",5
Van Gogh on Demand,Winnie Wong,2014-03-24,Art,"“Unsettles contemporary art’s unspoken hierarchies and topples modernist and postmodernist assumptions about originality, authenticity, and authorship.” —caa Reviews In a metropolis in south China lies Dafen, an urban village that houses thousands of workers who paint van Goghs, Da Vincis, Warhols, and other Western masterpieces for the world market, producing an astonishing five million paintings a year. Winnie Wong infiltrated this world, first investigating the work of conceptual artists; then working as a dealer; apprenticing as a painter; surveying wholesalers and retailers in Europe, East Asia and North America; establishing relationships with local leaders; and organizing a conceptual art exhibition for the Shanghai World Expo. The result is Van Gogh on Demand, a fascinating book about a little-known aspect of the global art world—one that sheds surprising light on the workings of art, artists, and individual genius. Wong describes an art world in which migrant workers, propaganda makers, dealers, and international artists make up a global supply chain of art. She examines how Berlin-based conceptual artist Christian Jankowski, who collaborated with Dafen’s painters to reimagine the Dafen Art Museum, unwittingly appropriated the work of a Hong Kong-based photographer Michael Wolf. She recounts how Liu Ding, a Beijing-based conceptual artist, asked Dafen “assembly-line” painters to perform at the Guangzhou Triennial, styling himself into a Dafen boss. Through such cases, Wong shows how Dafen’s painters force us to reexamine our preconceptions about the role of Chinese workers in redefining global art. “[A] fantastically detailed exploration of a topic which touches the heart of many of the issues surrounding China's economic rise.” —South China Morning Post",5

The Shape of Time,George Kubler,2008-04-17,Art,"When it was first released in 1962, The Shape of Time presented a radically new approach to the study of art history. Drawing upon new insights in fields such as anthropology and linguistics, George Kubler replaced the notion of style as the basis for histories of art with the concept of historical sequence and continuous change across time. Kubler’s classic work is now made available in a freshly designed edition. “The Shape of Time is as relevant now as it was in 1962. This book, a sober, deeply introspective, and quietly thrilling meditation on the flow of time and space and the place of objects within a larger continuum, adumbrates so many of the critical and theoretical concerns of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It is both appropriate and necessary that it re-appear in our consciousness at this time.”—Edward J. Sullivan, New York University This book will be of interest to all students of art history and to those concerned with the nature and theory of history in general. In a study of formal and symbolic durations the author presents a radically new approach to the problem of historical change. Using new ideas in anthropology and linguistics, he pursues such questions as the nature of time, the nature of change, and the meaning of invention. The result is a view of historical sequence aligned on continuous change more than upon the static notion of style—the usual basis for conventional histories of art. A carefully reasoned and brilliantly suggestive essay in defense of the view that the history of art can be the study of formal relationships, as against the view that it should concentrate on ideas of symbols or biography.—Harper's.It is a most important achievement, and I am sure that it will be studies for many years in many fields. I hope the book upsets people and makes them reformulate.—James Ackerman.In this brief and important essay, George Kubler questions the soundness of the stylistic basis of art historical studies. . . . The Shape of Time ably states a significant position on one of the most complex questions of modern art historical scholarship.—Virginia Quarterly Review.",5
The Road Less Traveled,M. Scott Peck,2012-03-13,Self-Help,"Now featuring a new introduction by Dr. M. Scott Peck, the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the classic bestseller The Road Less Traveled, celebrated by The Washington Post as “not just a book but a spontaneous act of generosity.” Perhaps no book in this generation has had a more profound impact on our intellectual and spiritual lives than The Road Less Traveled. With sales of more than seven million copies in the United States and Canada, and translations into more than twenty-three languages, it has made publishing history, with more than ten years on the New York Times bestseller list. Written in a voice that is timeless in its message of understanding, The Road Less Traveled continues to help us explore the very nature of loving relationships and leads us toward a new serenity and fullness of life. It helps us learn how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become a more sensitive parent; and ultimately how to become one’s own true self. Recognizing that, as in the famous opening line of his book, “Life is difficult” and that the journey to spiritual growth is a long one, Dr. Peck never bullies his readers, but rather guides them gently through the hard and often painful process of change toward a higher level of self-understanding.",4

Truth in Translation,Jason David BeDuhn,2003-04-29,Religion,"Written with the student and interested public in mind, Truth in Translation aims to explain what is involved and what is at stake in Bible translation. It begins with brief treatments of the background to the Bible and its translation, the various approaches to translation, and the specific origins of nine translation versions in wide use in the English-speaking world today. It then proceeds to compare those versions on nine points of translation, ranging from individual terms, to difficult passages, to whole categories of grammar. The book serves to inform readers of the forces at work shaping the meaning of the Bible, to help in their selection of Bible translations, and to act as a critical catalyst for the improvement of Bible translations through more careful attention to the risk of bias in the translation process.",5
Battle for the American Mind,"Pete Hegseth, David Goodwin",2022-06-14,Political Science,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER! President Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has written a revolutionary road map to saving our children from leftist indoctrination. Behind a smokescreen of “preparing students for the new industrial economy,” early progressives had political control in mind. America’s original schools didn’t just make kids memorize facts or learn skills; they taught them to think freely and arrive at wisdom. They assigned the classics, inspired love of God and country, and raised future citizens that changed the world forever. Today, after 16,000 hours of K-12 indoctrination, our kids come out of government schools hating America. They roll their eyes at religion and disdain our history. We spend more money on education than ever, but kids can barely read and write—let alone reason with discernment. Western culture is on the ropes. Kids are bored and aimless, flailing for purpose in a system that says racial and gender identity is everything. Battle for the American Mind is the untold story of the Progressive plan to neutralize the basis of our Republic – by removing the one ingredient that had sustained Western Civilization for thousands of years. Pete Hegseth and David Goodwin explain why, no matter what political skirmishes conservatives win, progressives are winning the war—and control the “supply lines” of future citizens. Reversing this reality will require parents to radically reorient their children’s education; even most homeschooling and Christian schooling are infused with progressive assumptions. We need to recover a lost philosophy of education – grounded in virtue and excellence – that can arm future generations to fight for freedom. It’s called classical Christian education. Never heard of it? You’re not alone. Battle for the American Mind is more than a book; it’s a field guide for remaking school in the United States. We’ve ceded our kids’ minds to the left for far too long—this book gives patriotic parents the ammunition to join an insurgency that gives America a fighting chance. Whether you're a conservative looking to push back against the progressive agenda or simply someone who cares about the education of our children, this book is for you.",2
The Tyranny of Heaven,Michael Bryson,2004,Literary Criticism,"The Tyranny of Heaven argues for a new way of reading the figure of Milton's God, contending that Milton rejects kings on earth and in heaven. Though Milton portrays God as a king in Paradise Lost, he does this neither to endorse kingship nor to recommend a monarchical model of deity. Instead, he recommends the Son, who in Paradise Regained rejects external rule as the model of politics and theology for Milton's fit audience though few. The portrait of God in Paradise Lost serves as a scathing critique of the English people and its slow but steady backsliding into the political habits of a nation long used to living under the yoke of kingship, a nation that maintained throughout its brief period of liberty the image of God as a heavenly king, and finally welcomed with open arms the return of a human king. Michael Bryson is a Visiting Assistant Professor of English at Northwestern University.",3.5

Terror by Night,Terry Caffey,2011-10-12,Biography & Autobiography,"At 3:00 a.m. on March 1, 2008, Terry Caffey awoke to find his daughter’s boyfriend standing in his bedroom with a gun. An instant later the teen opened fire, killing Terry’s wife, his two sons, and wounding him 12 times, before setting the house ablaze. Terry fell into deep depression and planned to kill himself, but God intervened. Upon visiting his burned-out property, Terry noticed a scorched scrap of paper from one of his wife’s books leaning against a tree trunk. The page read: “[God,] I couldn’t understand why You would take my family and leave me behind to struggle along without them. And I guess I still don’t totally understand that part of it. But I do believe that You’re sovereign; You’re in control.” That page was like a direct message from God, and it turned Terry’s life around. Now, one year later, Terry is remarried, the adoptive father of two young sons, and working to rebuild his relationship with his 17-year-old daughter, who is currently serving two life sentences in a Texas state penitentiary for her involvement in the crimes. Terror by Night tells the compelling story of how Terry Caffey found peace after his wife and sons were brutally murdered and his teenage daughter implicated in the crime. Sharing never-before-told details about the night of the crime and subsequent murder trial, it explains how Terry was able to forgive the men who murdered his family, and how he even interceded with the prosecutors on their behalf. A powerful example of how the power of forgiveness can bring healing after tragedy and great loss, it shows how God can bring good out of even the darkest tragedies.",5

Todos los evangelios,Antonio Piñero (1941-),2010-03-03,Religion,"La presente edición contiene todos los evangelios que han llegado hasta nosotros, tanto canónicos como apócrifos. Llamamos evangelio al término utilizado a partir del siglo II en toda la cristiandad: «Libro que recoge los hechos y palabras de la vida de Jesús de Nazaret como buena noticia de salvación para todos los seres humanos ». En lo que se refiere a los llamados evangelios gnósticos, entendemos como tales a «los libros que contienen la revelación de Jesús, normalmente tras su resurrección, acerca del Dios trascendente, de la esencia espiritual de los elegidos y de su salvación». De este modo, son verdaderos evangelios también algunos libros que no se definen como tales y llevan títulos diferentes. Por tanto, el número de evangelios conocidos, y recogidos en este volumen, supera los setenta, aunque de algunos de ellos no conservamos más que el título o pequeños fragmentos. En este libro, un equipo de especialistas ha abordado por primera vez la traducción íntegra a partir de las lenguas originales -latín, griego, hebreo, siríaco, copto y árabe- de todos los textos evangélicos. Además, ofrecen al lector una ficha identificativa de cada texto -posibles autor y fecha del evangelio, lengua y fuentes disponibles-, así como una breve introducción que sitúa al lector en el contexto histórico y religioso del escrito.

The Heart of Islam,Seyyed Hossein Nasr,2009-03-17,Religion,"As the specter of religious extremism has become a fact of life today, the temptation is great to allow the evil actions and perspectives of a minority to represent an entire tradition. In the case of Islam, there has been much recent confusion in the Western world centered on distorted portrayals of its core values. Born of ignorance, such confusion feeds the very problem at hand. In The Heart of Islam one of the great intellectual figures in Islamic history offers a timely presentation of the core spiritual and social values of Islam: peace, compassion, social justice, and respect for the other. Seizing this unique moment in history to reflect on the essence of his tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr seeks to ""open a spiritual and intellectual space for mutual understanding."" Exploring Islamic values in scripture, traditional sources, and history, he also shows their clear counterparts in the Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing the common ground of the Abrahamic faiths. Nasr challenges members of the world's civilizations to stop demonizing others while identifying themselves with pure goodness and to turn instead to a deeper understanding of those shared values that can solve the acute problems facing humanity today. ""Muslims must ask themselves what went wrong within their own societies,"" he writes, ""but the West must also pose the same question about itself . . . whether we are Muslims, Jews, Christians, or even secularists, whether we live in the Islamic world or in the West, we are in need of meaning in our lives, of ethical norms to guide our actions, of a vision that would allow us to live at peace with each other and with the rest of God's creation."" Such help, he believes, lies at the heart of every religion and can lead the followers of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well as other religious and spiritual traditions to a new future of mutual respect and common global purpose. The Heart of Islam is a landmark presentation of enduring value that offers hope to humanity, and a compelling portrait of the beauty and appeal of the faith of 1.2 billion people.",3.5
Bringing Up Boys,James C. Dobson,2014-08-22,Religion,"Sensible advice and caring encouragement on raising boys from the nation’s most trusted parenting authority, Dr. James Dobson. With so much confusion about the role of men in our society, it’s no wonder so many parents and teachers are asking questions about how to bring up boys. Why are so many boys in crisis? What qualities should we be trying to instill in young males? Our culture has vilified masculinity. As a result, an entire generation of boys is growing up without a clear idea of what it means to be a man. In the runaway bestseller Bringing Up Boys, Dr. Dobson draws from his experience as a child psychologist and family counselor, as well as extensive research, to offer advice and encouragement based on a firm foundation of biblical principles. He addresses common questions parents ask when guiding boys into manhood, such as: How are boys fundamentally different from girls? What are the father’s and mother’s unique roles in their son’s life? How do you guide and discipline the next generation of boys to become godly men? How should you handle energetic and rambunctious behavior? Whether raising young children or teens, this is a must-read book for Christian parents, teachers, social workers, youth leaders, and counselors—anyone involved in the challenge of turning boys into good men.",5
The Meaning of Marriage,"Timothy Keller, Kathy Keller",2011-11-01,Religion,"“Incredibly rich with wisdom and insight that will leave the reader, whether single or married, feeling uplifted.” —The Washington Times Based on the acclaimed sermon series by New York Times bestselling author Timothy Keller, this book shows everyone—Christians, skeptics, singles, longtime married couples, and those about to be engaged—the vision of what marriage should be according to the Bible. Modern culture would have you believe that everyone has a soul mate; that romance is the most important part of a successful marriage; that your spouse is there to help you realize your potential; that marriage does not mean forever, but merely for now; and that starting over after a divorce is the best solution to seemingly intractable marriage issues. But these modern-day assumptions are wrong. Timothy Keller, with insights from Kathy, his wife of thirty-seven years, shows marriage to be a glorious relationship that is also misunderstood and mysterious. The Meaning of Marriage offers instruction on how to have a successful marriage, and is essential reading for anyone who wants to know God and love more deeply in this life.",4.5

Recognized as the greatest literary masterpiece in Arabic, the sacred text has nevertheless remained difficult to understand in its English translations. First published in 2004, M.A.S. Abdel Haleem's translation has been acclaimed for its success in avoiding archaism and cryptic language to produce a version that is both faithful to the original and easy to read.

Bonhoeffer,Eric Metaxas,2011-08-29,Biography & Autobiography,"Who better to face the greatest evil of the 20th century than a humble man of faith? As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a pastor and author. In this New York Times bestselling biography, Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life--the theologian and the spy--and draws them together to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil. In Bonhoeffer, Metaxas presents the fullest account of Bonhoeffer's life, including his: heart-wrenching decision to leave the safe haven of America to return to Hitler's Germany involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in ""Operation 7,"" the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland lifelong dedication to sharing the tenets of his faith This edition, revised and with a new introduction from the author, shares the deeply moving story through previously unavailable documents, including personal letters, detailed journal entries, and firsthand personal accounts to reveal never-before-seen dimensions of Bonhoeffer's life and work. Praise for Bonhoeffer: ""Metaxas has created a biography of uncommon power--intelligent, moving, well researched, vividly written, and rich in implication for our own lives. Or to put it another way: Buy this book. Read it. Then buy another copy and give it to a person you love. It's that good."" --Archbishop Charles Chaput, author, First Things ""Metaxas tells Bonhoeffer's story with passion and theological sophistication."" —Wall Street Journal ""Metaxas presents Bonhoeffer as a clear-headed, deeply convicted Christian who submitted to no one and nothing except God and his Word."" --Christianity Today ""Metaxas has written a book that adds a new dimension to World War II, a new understanding of how evil can seize the soul of a nation and a man of faith can confront it."" --Thomas Fleming, author, The New Dealers’ War",4.5

The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi,Mahatma Gandhi,2010-06-15,Religion,"Regarded in India as one of the most important books of the 20th century, Gandhi’s commentary on this classic Hindu text addresses the issues he felt most directly affected the spiritual lives of common people. The Bhagavad Gita, also called The Song of the Lord, is a 700-line section of a much longer Sanskrit war epic, the Mahabharata, about the legendary conflict between two branches of an Indian ruling family. Framed as a conversation between Krishna, an incarnation of the god Vishnu, and a general of one of the armies, the Gita is written in powerful poetic language meant to be chanted. Equally treasured as a guide to action, a devotional scripture, a philosophical text, and inspirational reading, it remains one of the world’s most influential, widely read spiritual books. The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi is based on talks given by Gandhi between February and November 1926 at the Satyagraha Ashram in Ahmedabad, India. During this time—a period when Gandhi had withdrawn from mass political activity—he devoted much of his time and energy to translating the Gita from Sanskrit into his native Gujarati. As a result, he met with his followers almost daily, after morning prayer sessions, to discuss the Gita’s contents and meaning as it unfolded before him. This book is the transcription of those daily sessions.",5

The 188th Crybaby Brigade,Joel Chasnoff,2010-02-09,Biography & Autobiography,"Look at me. Do you see me? Do you see me in my olive-green uniform, beret, and shiny black boots? Do you see the assault rifle slung across my chest? Finally! I am the badass Israeli soldier at the side of the road, in sunglasses, forearms like bricks. And honestly -- have you ever seen anything quite like me? Joel Chasnoff is twenty-four years old, an American, and the graduate of an Ivy League university. But when his career as a stand-up comic fails to get off the ground, Chasnoff decides it's time for a serious change of pace. Leaving behind his amenity-laden Brooklyn apartment for a plane ticket to Israel, Joel trades in the comforts of being a stereotypical American Jewish male for an Uzi, dog tags (with his name misspelled), and serious mental and physical abuse at the hands of the Israeli Army. The 188th Crybaby Brigade is a hilarious and poignant account of Chasnoff's year in the Israel Defense Forces -- a year that he volunteered for, and that he'll never get back. As a member of the 188th Armored Brigade, a unit trained on the Merkava tanks that make up the backbone of Israeli ground forces, Chasnoff finds himself caught in a twilight zone-like world of mandatory snack breaks, battalion sing-alongs, and eighteen-year-old Israeli mama's boys who feign injuries to get out of guard duty and claim diarrhea to avoid kitchen work. More time is spent arguing over how to roll a sleeve cuff than studying the mechanics of the Merkava tanks. The platoon sergeants are barely older than the soldiers and are younger than Chasnoff himself. By the time he's sent to Lebanon for a tour of duty against Hezbollah, Chasnoff knows everything about why snot dries out in the desert, yet has never been trained in firing the MAG. And all this while his relationship with his tough-as-nails Israeli girlfriend (herself a former drill sergeant) crumbles before his very eyes. The lone American in a platoon of eighteen-year-old Israelis, Chasnoff takes readers into the barracks; over, under, and through political fences; and face-to-face with the absurd reality of life in the Israeli Army. It is a brash and gritty depiction of combat, rife with ego clashes, breakdowns in morale, training mishaps that almost cost lives, and the barely containable sexual urges of a group of teenagers. What's more, it's an on-the-ground account of life in one of the most em-battled armies on earth -- an occupying force in a hostile land, surrounded by enemy governments and terrorists, reviled by much of the world. With equal parts irreverence and vulnerability, irony and intimacy, Chasnoff narrates a new kind of coming-of-age story -- one that teaches us, moves us, and makes us laugh.",5
Beautiful People,Simon Doonan,2009-04-14,Humor,"A wickedly funny memoir with echoes of David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs, Beautiful People (originally published in hardcover as Nasty) is now a BBC comedy hit series from the producer of Ab Fab and The Office. Proclaimed ""the most brilliant, brash thing in type"" by Liz Smith, Simon Doonan's saucy prose has established him as an emerging star among literary humorists. In this break-through memoir, reminiscent of both Sedaris and Burroughs, he revisits the landscape of his youth, and displays the irresistible charm that earned him his dedicated audience. Long before he became a celebrity in his own right--as the author of best-selling books, as the style arbiter of VH1 and America's Top Model, and the marketing genius behind Barney's New York--Simon Doonan was a ""scabby knee'd troll"" in Reading, England. In Beautiful People, Doonan returns to the working-class neighborhood of his youth, and chronicles the misadventures of the Doonan clan in all their wacky glory. Readers meet his mother Betty, whose gravity-defying, peroxide hairdo signified her natural glamour; his father Terry, an amateur vintner who turned parsnips into the legendary Chateau Doonan; his grandfather D.C., a hard-drinking betting man who plotted to win his fortune by turning Simon into a jockey; and his demented grandma Narg and schizophrenic Uncle Ken, both of whom lived upstairs. Fearing he would fall victim to the insanity that runs in his family, or, worse, the banality of suburban life, Doonan decamps with his flamboyant best-friend Biddie to London, where they hope to find the Beautiful People, that elusive clan who luxuriate on floor pillows and amuse each other with bon mots. Throughout the memoir--in essays about family holidays, the tart who lived next door, his first job--Doonan continues his bumbling pursuit of the fabulous life, only to learn, in the end, that perhaps the Beautiful People were the ones he left behind.",3

"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs",Chuck Klosterman,2003-08-26,Social Science,"Over half a million copies sold! From the author of the highly acclaimed heavy metal memoir, Fargo Rock City, comes another hilarious and discerning take on massively popular culture—set in Chuck Klosterman’s den and your own—covering everything from the effect of John Cusack flicks to the crucial role of breakfast cereal to the awesome power of the Dixie Chicks. Countless writers and artists have spoken for a generation, but no one has done it quite like Chuck Klosterman. With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Internet porn, Pamela Anderson, literary Jesus freaks, and the real difference between apples and oranges (of which there is none). And don’t even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation. Whether deconstructing Saved by the Bell episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of The Empire Strikes Back or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he’ll make you laugh, and he’ll drive you insane—usually all at once. Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, but—really—it’s about us. All of us. As Klosterman realizes late at night, in the moment before he falls asleep, “In and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever ‘in and of itself.’” Read to believe.",2

Available As Is,Debbie Weiss,2022-09-13,Biography & Autobiography,"After losing her husband, George—her one and only since high school prom—to cancer, fifty-year-old Debbie Weiss found herself opening a new chapter of life that she didn’t know how to start. Initially, she binge-watched Netflix and drank Manhattans. Then she became a dating monster—starting with J-Date and then moving on to multiple other sites. Soon, Debbie was averaging two dates a day; in the blink of an eye, she’d gone from respectable widow to the girl you’d do in your Trans Am but wouldn’t take to the prom. At one point, she was actually dating four guys at once, including a politician who refused to let Debbie meet his family because they’d met online. But as she juggled these many men, she began to feel that midlife dating was less an earnest romantic endeavor and more a battle of the sexes . . . and the line in the sand was how much women were willing to tolerate. Fed up, Debbie went offline. Only then, without the distraction of dating to keep her busy, did she finally, truly grieve her loss—and as she did, she also realized that she needed to forgive herself, both for George’s death and for losing her identity in their marriage. Equal parts poignant and punchy, Available As Is is a darkly humorous account of seeking love—but finding yourself.",5

Do You Talk Funny?,David Nihill,2016-03-08,Self-Help,"Public speaking can be terrifying. For David Nihill, the idea of standing in front of an audience was scarier than cliff jumping into a thorny pit of spiders and mothers-in-law. Without a parachute or advanced weaponry. Something had to change. In what doesn't sound like the best plan ever, David decided to overcome his fears by pretending to be an accomplished comedian called ""Irish Dave"" for one full year, crashing as many comedy clubs, festivals, and shows as possible. One part of the plan was at least logical: he was already Irish and already called Dave. In one year, David went from being deathly afraid of public speaking to hosting a business conference, regularly performing stand-up comedy and winning storytelling competitions in front of packed houses. And he did it by learning from some of the best public speakers in the world: stand-up comedians. Do You Talk Funny?: 7 Comedy Habits to Become a Better (and Funnier) Public Speaker shows how the key principles of stand-up comedy can be applied to your speaking engagements and presentations to make you funnier, more interesting, and better looking. (Or at least two of the three.) Whether you are preparing for a business presentation, giving a wedding toast, defending your thesis, raising money from investors, or simply want to take on something you're afraid of, this book will take you from sweaty to stage-ready. You'll learn how to: - Craft a story and content that your audience will want to listen to - Find the funniest parts of your material and how to get to them faster - Deal with stage fright - Master the two most important parts of your performance: timing and delivery Ten percent of the author's proceeds from this book will go to Arash Bayatmakou via Help Hope Live until he is fully back on his feet and thereafter to one of the many facing the same challenges after suffering a severe spinal cord injury.",5
The Last Black Unicorn,Tiffany Haddish,2017-12-05,Humor,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “An inspiring story that manages to be painful, honest, shocking, bawdy and hilarious.” —The New York Times Book Review From stand-up comedian, actress, and breakout star of Girls Trip, Tiffany Haddish, comes The Last Black Unicorn, a sidesplitting, hysterical, edgy, and unflinching collection of (extremely) personal essays, as fearless as the author herself. Growing up in one of the poorest neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles, Tiffany learned to survive by making people laugh. If she could do that, then her classmates would let her copy their homework, the other foster kids she lived with wouldn’t beat her up, and she might even get a boyfriend. Or at least she could make enough money—as the paid school mascot and in-demand Bar Mitzvah hype woman—to get her hair and nails done, so then she might get a boyfriend. None of that worked (and she’s still single), but it allowed Tiffany to imagine a place for herself where she could do something she loved for a living: comedy. Tiffany can’t avoid being funny—it’s just who she is, whether she’s plotting shocking, jaw-dropping revenge on an ex-boyfriend or learning how to handle her newfound fame despite still having a broke person’s mind-set. Finally poised to become a household name, she recounts with heart and humor how she came from nothing and nowhere to achieve her dreams by owning, sharing, and using her pain to heal others. By turns hilarious, filthy, and brutally honest, The Last Black Unicorn shows the world who Tiffany Haddish really is—humble, grateful, down-to-earth, and funny as hell. And now, she’s ready to inspire others through the power of laughter.",5

The International Handbook of Parental Alienation Syndrome,"Richard A. Gardner, S. Richard Sauber, Demosthenes Lorandos",2006,Medical,"The dramatic increase in the number of child-custody disputes since the seventies has created an equally dramatic need for a standard reference work that examines the growing social problem of children who develop an irrational hatred for a parent as the result of divorce. The International Handbook of Parental Alienation Syndrome: Conceptual, Clinical, and Legal Considerations features clinical, legal, and research perspectives from 32 contributors representing eight countries, building on the work of the late Dr. Richard Gardner, a pioneer in the theory, practice, diagnosis, and treatment of Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS). This unique book addresses the effects of PAS on parents and children, discusses issues surrounding reconciliation between parent and alienated child, and includes material published for the first time on incidence, gender, and false allegations of abuse in PAS. Content highlights examines PAS and the roles of family members, the criminal justice system, and the need for public awareness and policymakers to respond to PAS. Descriptive statistics on 84 cases are given, and the factors affecting reconciliation between the child and target parent are listed. The mild, moderate, and severe categories of PAS are explored, and the psychological consequences of PAS indoctrination for adult children of divorce and the effects of alienation on parents are researched. The role of medical reports in the development of PAS, sexual abuse allegations, and future predictions on the fate of PAS children are many of the clinical considerations in this book. The legal issues concern PAS in American law, criticisms of PAS in courts of law, protecting the fundamental rights of children in families, family law reform, International PAS abductions, and the legal requirements of experts giving evidence to courts. The impact and implications of PAS are immense, and no other single source provides the depth and breadth of coverage of the topic than the clinical and forensic chapters in this book.",1

"Religious Ideas, Feelings and Their Interrelationship",Theo van der Zee,2007,Religion,"Religious education seeks to help students acquire religious ideas by interpreting religious and other stories in accordance with their life world. Schools pursue this goal by organising religious learning activities. The question is whether the acquisition of religious ideas is possible for young students, considering the difficulties such as the complex and not readily understandable religious stories, and social developments as de-institutionalisation, de-traditionalisation and pluralisation? What are the possibilities for primary schools of teaching their students knowledge about religious ideas? What is the influence of feelings on the acquisition? What possibilities in the form of learning arrangements can be created for primary school students, with their diverse religious backgrounds, to acquire religious ideas optimally? That is the cardinal problem explored in this study.",5
Child Domestic Work in Nigeria,"Gankam Tambo, Ina",2014-10-30,Child labor,"For the last two decades, child domestic work carried out in Nigeria as well as in other countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia, has been given increasing attention by international policy makers and scientists. Yet, the research mainly focuses on the living and working conditions of these children, which also forms part of this book. However, in addition, political and pedagogical measures of intervention employed on international, national and local levels on child domestic work are also at the centre of analysis. Against the background of post-colonial theory the author studies the effects of social modernisation in Nigeria as a rapidly growing national economy on child domestic work and historically retraces the origins of this form of child work back to indigenous modes of socialisation and social security within the (pre-colonial) Nigerian extended family network. The research is based on field work in Nigeria, including interviews and documentary analysis.",5

The Sight of Sound,Richard Leppert,1993-12-01,Music,"Richard Leppert boldly examines the social meanings of music as these have been shaped not only by hearing but also by seeing music in performance. His purview is the northern European bourgeoisie, principally in England and the Low Countries, from 1600 to 1900. And his particular interest is the relation of music to the human body. He argues that musical practices, invariably linked to the body, are inseparable from the prevailing discourses of power, knowledge, identity, desire, and sexuality. With the support of 100 illustrations, Leppert addresses music and the production of racism, the hoarding of musical sound in a culture of scarcity, musical consumption and the policing of gender, the domestic piano and misogyny, music and male anxiety, and the social silencing of music. His unexpected yoking of musicology and art history, in particular his original insights into the relationships between music, visual representation, and the history of the body, make exciting reading for scholars, students, and all those interested in society and the arts.",3

The book explores the natural laws that govern the subtleties of balance, the techniques of leaps and pirouettes, and the impressive lifts and turns executed by ballet partners. Finally, Laws offers insight into two current discussions in the dance world--the effect of body size on ballet technique, and the relationship between science and the art of dance. Beautiful, original stop-action photographs by Martha Swope, along with clear diagrams, illustrate the concepts described in the text. Plus, an intriguing ""puzzler"" at the beginning of each chapter provides an engaging entrée into the topics presented. For those who want a more advanced understanding of the physics, extensive appendices are provided. This new book combines the best features of Laws's widely acclaimed The Physics of Dance and Physics, Dance, and the Pas de Deux by Laws and Cynthia Harvey. Its expert application of the basic principles of physics to the art of dance will be an invaluable resource for dancers and dance instructors and will open a new level of appreciation for lovers of the form. It will also appeal to physicists who seek to include the arts in their scientific pursuits.",5

The View from the Back of the Band,Chris Smith,2014-10-15,Biography & Autobiography,"Mel Lewis (1929-1990) was born Melvin Sokoloff to Jewish Russian immigrants in Buffalo, New York. He first picked up his father's drumsticks at the age of two and at 17 he was a full-time professional musician. The View from the Back of the Band is the first biography of this legendary jazz drummer. For over fifty years, Lewis provided the blueprint for how a drummer could subtly support any musical situation. While he made his name with Stan Kenton and Thad Jones, and with his band at the Village Vanguard, it was the hundreds of recordings that he made as a sideman and his ability to mentor young musicians that truly defined his career. Away from the drums, Lewis's passionate and outspoken personality made him one of jazz music's greatest characters. It is often through Lewis's own anecdotes, as well as many from the musicians who knew him best, that this book traces the career of one of the world's greatest drummers. Previously unpublished interviews, personal memoirs, photos, musical transcriptions, and a selected discography add to this comprehensive biography.",5

Here's the Story,Maureen McCormick,2009-10-06,Biography & Autobiography,"Marcia! Marcia! Marcia! Marcia Brady, eldest daughter on television's The Brady Bunch, had it all—style, looks, boys, brains, and talent. No wonder her younger sister Jan was jealous! For countless adolescents across America who came of age in the early 1970s, Marcia was the ideal American teenager. Girls wanted to be her. Boys wanted to date her. But what viewers didn't know about the always-sunny, perfect Marcia was that offscreen, her real-life counterpart, Maureen McCormick, the young actress who portrayed her, was living a very different—and not-so-wonderful—life. Now, for the very first time, Maureen tells the shocking and inspirational true story of the beloved teen generations have invited into their living rooms—and the woman she became. In Here's the Story, Maureen takes us behind the scenes of America's favorite television family, the Bradys. With poignancy and candor, she reveals the lifelong friendships, the hurtful jealousies, the offscreen romance, the loving support her television family provided during a life-or-death moment, and the inconsolable loss of a man who had been a second father. But The Brady Bunch was only the beginning. Haunted by the perfection of her television alter ego, Maureen landed on the dark side, caught up in a fast-paced, drug-fueled, star-studded Hollywood existence that ultimately led to the biggest battle of her life. Moving from drug dens on Wonderland Avenue to wild parties at the Playboy mansion and exotic escapades on the beaches of Hawaii, this candid, hard-hitting memoir exposes a side of a beloved pop-culture icon the paparazzi missed. Yet it is also a story of remarkable success. After kicking her drug habit, Maureen battled depression, reconnected with her mother, whom she nursed through the end of her life, and then found herself in a pitched battle for her family in which she ultimately triumphed. There is no question: Maureen McCormick is a survivor. After fifty years, she has finally learned what it means to love the person you are, insight that has brought her peace in a happy marriage and as a mother. Here's the Story is the empowering, engaging, shocking, and emotional tale of Maureen McCormick's courageous struggle over adversity and her lifelong battle to come to terms with the idea of perfection—and herself.",3
Guitar Zero,Gary Marcus,2012-01-19,Music,"On the eve of his 40th birthday, Gary Marcus, a renowned scientist with no discernible musical talent, learns to play the guitar and investigates how anyone—of any age —can become musical. Do you have to be born musical to become musical? Do you have to start at the age of six? Using the tools of his day job as a cognitive psychologist, Gary Marcus becomes his own guinea pig as he takes up the guitar. In a powerful and incisive look at how both children and adults become musical, Guitar Zero traces Marcus’s journey, what he learned, and how anyone else can learn, too. A groundbreaking peek into the origins of music in the human brain, this musical journey is also an empowering tale of the mind’s enduring plasticity. Marcus investigates the most effective ways to train body and brain to learn to play an instrument, in a quest that takes him from Suzuki classes to guitar gods. From deliberate and efficient practicing techniques to finding the right music teacher, Marcus translates his own experience—as well as reflections from world-renowned musicians—into practical advice for anyone hoping to become musical, or to learn a new skill. Guitar Zero debunks the popular theory of an innate musical instinct while simultaneously challenging the idea that talent is only a myth. While standing the science of music on its head, Marcus brings new insight into humankind’s most basic question: what counts as a life well lived? Does one have to become the next Jimi Hendrix to make a passionate pursuit worthwhile, or can the journey itself bring the brain lasting satisfaction? For all those who have ever set out to play an instrument—or wish that they could—Guitar Zero is an inspiring and fascinating look at the pursuit of music, the mechanics of the mind, and the surprising rewards that come from following one’s dreams.",3
The Beatles,Michael R. Frontani,2009-09-18,Music,"The Beatles: Image and the Media charts the transformation of the Beatles from teen idols to leaders of the youth movement and powerful cultural agents. Drawing upon American mainstream print media, broadcasts, albums, films, and videos, the study covers the band's career in the United States. Michael R. Frontani explores how the Beatles' media image evolved and how this transformation related to cultural and historical events. Upon their arrival in the U.S., the Beatles wore sharply tailored suits and cast themselves as adorable, accessible teen heartthrobs. By the end of the decade, they had absorbed the fashion and consciousness of the burgeoning counterculture and were using their interviews, media events, and music to comment on issues such as the Vietnam War, drug culture, and civil rights. Frontani traces the steps that led to this change and comments on how the band's mantra of essential optimism never wavered despite the evolution of its media profile.",5

But like Alice in Wonderland after she plunged down the rabbit hole, what seemed like a fairytale life inside the Playboy Mansion—including A-list celebrity parties and her own #1-rated television show—quickly devolved into an oppressive routine of strict rules, manipulation, and battles with ambitious, backstabbing bunnies.

Somebody to Love?,"Grace Slick, Andrea Cagan",2008-12-04,Biography & Autobiography,"A candid autobiography of the great rock diva of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship, revealing her wild life at the forefront of the Sixties and Seventies counterculture. She has been called rock and roll's original female outlaw, as famous for her bad behavior as for her haunting singing voice. In her 25-year career as a musician, Grace Slick charted dozens of hits and sold millions of albums. From ""White Rabbit"" and ""Somebody to Love"" to ""Sarah"" and ""Miracles"", the songs she performed became the anthems of a generation. Whether describing her antics at the White House with Abbie Hoffman or the unforgettable experience that was Woodstock, Slick's recollections have the same rich imagery found in her lyrics. In this provocative narrative, readers will discover the many sides of Grace Slick: as artistic pioneer; she records songs with Jerry Garcia and David Crosby; as practitioner of freedom and rebellion; she sleeps with Jim Morrison and gets arrested for DUI on three separate occasions (without actually being in a car); and as a loving mother to actress China Kantner, she tries to balance casual friendship with parental wisdom. Slick offers a revealing self-portrait of the complex woman behind the rock-outlaw image, and delivers a behind-the-scenes, no-holds-barred view of the people and spirit that defined a quarter-century of American pop culture.

Western Involvement in Nkrumah's Downfall,Godfrey Mwakikagile,2015-03-27,History,"The author shows the role played by Western governments and intelligence agencies in overthrowing Ghana's first president, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. They worked together to weaken and undermine his government, and they facilitated the military coup which ended his rule. He has used declassified material including interviews with former American ambassadors to Ghana, as well as other sources, to document his study. He contends that the Ghanaian army and police officers who overthrew Nkrumah may not have succeeded, when they did, in ousting Nkrumah had Western powers, especially the United States, not been involved in the plot to oust him. They participated in planning the coup. But he also concedes that it is possible the Ghanaian coup makers would have, on their own, succeeded later in overthrowing Nkrumah. Major Akwasi Afrifa, one of the leaders of the February 1966 coup in which Nkrumah was ousted, planned twice – in 1962 and in 1964 – to overthrow Nkrumah but the plots were discovered by the security forces before they could be carried out. The author acknowledges that Nkrumah had enemies within and faced strong opposition to his rule. But he also contends that there was a concerted effort by Western powers, especially the United States, to overthrow Nkrumah that should not be overlooked when examining his downfall. They worked in collusion with his enemies within.

The book includes photos. His forthcoming book, “Ghana after Nkrumah,” complements this work.",5
